The data encompasses crucial metrics such as OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, VOLUME and additional trading-derived values (OHLCV+), offering a comprehensive view of an index's historical performance. This information is essential for conducting in-depth market analyses and making informed decisions based on past trends.","x-extended-description-with-markdown":"This endpoint is meticulously designed to provide historical candlestick data for various indices, captured at one-day intervals. The data encompasses crucial metrics such as OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, VOLUME and additional trading-derived values (OHLCV+), offering a comprehensive view of an index's historical performance. This information is essential for conducting in-depth market analyses and making informed decisions based on past trends.\n\nA notable feature of this data is that the **OPEN** value for each day (00:00 GMT) is based on the **CLOSE** value of the preceding day (or the closest previous day that had trading activity). This relationship can potentially influence the **HIGH** and **LOW** values recorded within a day, as they are relative to the starting **OPEN** value. It's important to emphasize that the additional message metrics are derived exclusively from trading activities within the specific day. These extra metrics include:\n\n- **FIRST_MESSAGE_TIMESTAMP**, **FIRST_MESSAGE_VALUE**, **LAST_MESSAGE_TIMESTAMP** - Timestamps and values for the first and last index updates, the LAST_MESSAGE_VALUE is not provided since it is the same as the CLOSE.\n- **HIGH_MESSAGE_VALUE**, **HIGH_MESSAGE_TIMESTAMP**, **LOW_MESSAGE_VALUE**, **LOW_MESSAGE_TIMESTAMP** - The highest and lowest index values within the day, along with their corresponding timestamps.\n- **TOTAL_INDEX_UPDATES** - The total count of index updates during the day.\n- **VOLUME_TOP_TIER**, **QUOTE_VOLUME_TOP_TIER**, **VOLUME_DIRECT**, **QUOTE_VOLUME_DIRECT**, **VOLUME_TOP_TIER_DIRECT**, **QUOTE_VOLUME_TOP_TIER_DIRECT** - In-depth volume information, covering both top-tier and direct trading volumes within the day. These are the total sum of all the trading volume in both the base currency (VOLUME) and quote currency (QUOTE_VOLUME). These extra volume values are **only available** for **CADLI** and other **Real-Time Adaptive Methodology** indices.\n\nIf the 'fill' URL parameter is left empty or set to true (1), then on days with no trading activity, the OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE values will match the CLOSE of the previous closest hour with trading activity. In such cases, the VOLUME, QUOTE_VOLUME, and TOTAL_INDEX_UPDATES will be set to 0, and all the extra, trading-related metrics described above will be absent. Conversely, setting 'fill=false' in the request URL will exclude days with no trading activity from the response.\n\nThe endpoint features four distinct response types, each tailored to cater to specific historical data requirements:\n\n- **Type 227 (Direct Trading Methodology)**: Delivers historical candlestick data for the CCIX index. This data is pivotal for analyzing the historical price movements and trends specific to the CCIX, offering insights into its long-term performance.\n- **Type 267 (Real-Time Adaptive Methodology)**: Provides historical candlestick information for the CADLI index. This type is specifically designed to facilitate the analysis of CADLI's historical USD price movements, allowing users to track and evaluate its past market behavior.\n- **Type 986 (Real-Time Adaptive Methodology + Conversion)**: Extends the CADLI historical data by incorporating currency conversion factors. This response type is ideal for users requiring historical data on CADLI, adjusted for conversions into other fiat or digital currencies, enabling more diverse financial analyses.\n- **Type 989 (Real-Time Adaptive Methodology + Inversion)**: Offers a unique perspective on CADLI's historical data by applying price inversions. This response type is tailored for users who need to understand the historical USD value in terms of various other currencies or assets, providing a comprehensive inverted price analysis.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Long-term Trend Analysis**: Investors and analysts can observe the long-term trends in market behavior by examining daily price movements and volume metrics.\n- **Strategic Investment Planning**: Enables portfolio managers to devise long-term investment strategies based on historical performance trends of indices.\n- **Risk Management**: Risk analysts use daily historical data to identify patterns or events that may indicate future risks or opportunities.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **Investment Analysts and Portfolio Managers**: Professionals who make strategic decisions based on long-term market performance.\n- **Financial Historians**: Researchers studying the historical movements of financial markets.\n- **Risk Management Experts**: Analysts who specialize in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating long-term financial risks.","tags":["Indices & Ref.

The data includes key metrics like OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, VOLUME and additional trading-derived values (OHLCV+), enabling users to gain a detailed understanding of short-term index behaviors. This granular data is invaluable for users conducting time-sensitive market analysis or those interested in intra-day trading patterns.\n\nA notable feature of this data is that the **OPEN** value for each hour is based on the **CLOSE** value of the preceding hour (or the closest previous hour that had trading activity). This relationship can potentially influence the **HIGH** and **LOW** values recorded within a hour, as they are relative to the starting **OPEN** value. It's important to emphasize that the additional message metrics are derived exclusively from trading activities within the specific hour. These extra metrics include:\n\n- **FIRST_MESSAGE_TIMESTAMP**, **FIRST_MESSAGE_VALUE**, **LAST_MESSAGE_TIMESTAMP** - Timestamps and values for the first and last index updates, the LAST_MESSAGE_VALUE is not provided since it is the same as the CLOSE.\n- **HIGH_MESSAGE_VALUE**, **HIGH_MESSAGE_TIMESTAMP**, **LOW_MESSAGE_VALUE**, **LOW_MESSAGE_TIMESTAMP** - The highest and lowest index values within the hour, along with their corresponding timestamps.\n- **TOTAL_INDEX_UPDATES** - The total count of index updates during the hour.\n- **VOLUME_TOP_TIER**, **QUOTE_VOLUME_TOP_TIER**, **VOLUME_DIRECT**, **QUOTE_VOLUME_DIRECT**, **VOLUME_TOP_TIER_DIRECT**, **QUOTE_VOLUME_TOP_TIER_DIRECT** - In-depth volume information, covering both top-tier and direct trading volumes within the hour. These are the total sum of all the trading volume in both the base currency (VOLUME) and quote currency (QUOTE_VOLUME). These extra volume values are **only available** for **CADLI** and other **Real-Time Adaptive Methodology** indices.\n\nIf the 'fill' URL parameter is left empty or set to true (1), then on hours with no trading activity, the OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE values will match the CLOSE of the previous closest hour with trading activity. In such cases, the VOLUME, QUOTE_VOLUME, and TOTAL_INDEX_UPDATES will be set to 0, and all the extra, trading-related metrics described above will be absent. Conversely, setting 'fill=false' in the request URL will exclude hours with no trading activity from the response.\n\nThe endpoint includes four specialized response types, each serving a unique aspect of hourly data analysis:\n\n- **Type 227 (Direct Trading Methodology)**: Provides hourly candlestick data specifically for the CCIX index. This response type is essential for users looking to analyze short-term price movements and trends in the CCIX index, offering insights into its intra-day performance.\n- **Type 267 (Real-Time Adaptive Methodology)**: Delivers hourly candlestick data for the CADLI index. Tailored for an in-depth examination of CADLI's USD price movements within each hour, this type allows users to closely monitor and analyze CADLI's short-term market behavior.\n- **Type 986 (Real-Time Adaptive Methodology + Conversion)**: Enhances the CADLI hourly data with currency conversion factors. It's ideal for users who need intra-day CADLI data adjusted for conversions into other fiat or digital currencies, enabling nuanced financial analysis across different currencies.\n- **Type 989 (Real-Time Adaptive Methodology + Inversion )**: Offers hourly CADLI data with an inversion feature. This type is designed for users seeking to understand the intra-day USD value in terms of other currencies or assets, providing a detailed view of inverted price movements on an hourly basis.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Intraday Trading Strategy Development**: Traders can develop and refine trading strategies by analyzing how indices move within each hour.\n- **Event-Driven Analysis**: Allows analysts to dissect market reactions to specific hourly news events or economic releases.\n- **Performance Benchmarking**: Enables comparison of hourly performance against broader market movements, helping in performance assessment and adjustment.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **Day Traders and Intraday Analysts**: Professionals focused on short-term trading who rely on hourly fluctuations to make buying and selling decisions.\n- **Quantitative Analysts**: Specialists in developing models that predict short-term market behaviors based on historical data.\n- **Event Analysts**: Researchers focusing on the impact of specific events on market indices within concise time frames.","tags":["Indices & Ref.

Users can specify a starting timestamp, ensuring they receive all subsequent ticks, thereby maintaining an up-to-the-minute view of market movements without any gaps in data.","x-extended-description-with-markdown":"This endpoint retrieves historical tick-level data for reference rate indices starting from a specified timestamp. Tailored for keeping users up to date with the latest data, it allows for precise targeting of the exact moment from which the data retrieval should begin. This functionality is essential for applications that require continuous data updates, such as dynamic risk management tools or real-time analytics platforms. Users can specify a starting timestamp, ensuring they receive all subsequent ticks, thereby maintaining an up-to-the-minute view of market movements without any gaps in data.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Granular Index Update Data**: Access detailed index update information including timestamps with nanosecond precision, values, quantities, and components data.\n- **Unique CCSEQ Numbers**: Each index update includes an individual CryptoCompare Sequence (CCSEQ) number for precise tracking and sequencing.\n- **Real-Time Data Retrieval**: Obtain data starting from any given timestamp to focus on specific calculation periods or events.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Real-Time Analytics**: Enable analysts to continuously update their models and dashboards with the most recent data.\n- **Dynamic Risk Management**: Provide risk managers with the ability to monitor and respond to live market changes.\n- **Event-Driven Trading**: Support trading strategies that react to market events as they unfold in real time.\n\n### Target Audiences\n- **Financial Data Analysts**: Those requiring the latest market data for immediate analysis.\n- **Risk Managers**: Professionals who need to keep track of real-time market fluctuations to manage exposure effectively.\n- **Algorithmic Traders**: Traders who utilize real-time data feeds to automate trading based on current market conditions.\n\n### Data Handling Notes\n- **Identifying the First Update Timestamp**: To accurately determine the timestamp of the first update for any given instrument, utilize the FIRST_INDEX_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP provided by the Markets + Instruments endpoint. This value is essential for establishing the starting point of your data analysis and ensuring that you capture the complete history of trading activity from the onset. **This is the only time you should not be adding the last_ccseq parameter in your request**.\n- **Handling Identical Timestamps in Pagination**: If all returned index updates share the same timestamp, refine your pagination by including both the timestamp of the last index update in the after_ts parameter and its CCSEQ in the last_ccseq parameter. Always adding last_ccseq in your requests ensures seamless pagination without missing any index updates.\n- **Skipping Invalid Index Updates**: To maintain data accuracy, there are instances where index updates may be marked as INVALID due to exchange API errors or data processing issues. You can set the skip_invalid_messages parameter to true to omit these invalid index updates. However, this will result in gaps in CCSEQ numbers, making it harder to confirm the receipt of all index updates. For comprehensive data, we recommend not skipping invalid index updates.\n- **Efficient Data Backfilling**: While this endpoint is ideal for staying up to date with the latest index updates, it is not efficient for backfilling historical data or catching up on multiple days of missed index updates. For backfilling, use the [Index Updates Full Hour Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/index_cc_v2_historical_messages_hour) instead. This endpoint stores index updates in hourly batches, which can contain up to 5 million index updates per hour. Using the real-time endpoint for backfilling is inefficient, as it would require downloading large volumes of data only to use a fraction of it.\n\nBy leveraging this endpoint, users gain access to high-resolution index update data essential for precise market analysis, application development, and strategic planning in the dynamic cryptocurrency trading environment.","tags":["Indices & Ref.

The substantial data size may impact memory usage and processing time.\n- **Efficient Data Processing with CSV Format**: For most cases, setting `response_format=CSV` will make large hourly trade files easier to process. This format allows you to handle data in chunks as it streams, improving efficiency and reducing memory overhead.\n- **Chunked Data Transmission**: Our endpoint pulls data in chunks of 16,000 trades from our blob storage, transforms it, and sends it to Nginx, which gzips it and delivers it to you if you've requested gzipped responses. For trades in the last 4 hours, we pull them in chunks of 1,000 trades from our Redis cluster and send them to Nginx. This chunked approach helps manage large volumes of data more effectively.\n- **Optimizing Data Retrieval**: Implement data streaming and chunk processing in your application to handle large datasets without overwhelming system resources. This is especially important when dealing with high-frequency trading data.\n- **Alternative for Recent Trades**: If you need to stay up to date with the latest trades at intervals more frequent than hourly, consider using the [Trades by Timestamp Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/spot_v2_historical_trades). This endpoint is better suited for real-time data retrieval and incremental updates.\n- **Data Integrity Considerations**: Be aware that some trades may be marked as INVALID due to exchange API errors or data processing issues. While you can set the `skip_invalid_messages` parameter to true to omit these trades, doing so may result in gaps in CCSEQ numbers, complicating the verification of complete data retrieval. For thorough analysis, it's recommended not to skip invalid messages.\n\nBy leveraging the Trades Full Hour endpoint, users can obtain comprehensive trade data essential for in-depth market analysis, compliance efforts, and strategic planning in the dynamic cryptocurrency trading environment.","tags":["Spot"],"operationId":"spot_v2_historical_trades_hour","x-section":"Spot","x-subsection":"Trade","x-roles-required":["free","premium"],"x-cache-length-seconds":3600,"x-visible-in-ai":false,"x-endpoint-group-id":"spot_v1_historical_trade","x-endpoint-group-name":"Trades","parameters":[{"name":"market","in":"query","description":"The exchange to obtain data from","required":true,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"string","enum":["aax","abcc","acx","aidosmarket","alphaex","archax","ascendex","ataix","backpack","bequant","bgogo","bibox365","bigone","bilaxy","binance","binanceaggregate","binanceusa","bingx","bisq","bit","bit2c","bit2me","bitbank","bitbay","bitbns","bitbuy","bitci","bitexbook","bitfex","bitfinex","bitflyer","bitflyereu","bitflyerfx","bitflyerus","bitforex","bitget","bithumbglobal","bithumbkorea","bitinka","bitkub","bitmart","bitmex","bitopro","bitpanda","bitrue","bitso","bitstamp","bittrex","bitunix","bitvavo","bkex","blackturtle","bleutrade","blockchaincom","btcalpha","btcbox","btcex","btcmarkets","btcturk","btse","buda","bullish","buyucoin","bwexchange","bybit","bydfi","catex","cexio","coinbase","coinbaseinternational","coincheck","coincorner","coindcx","coindeal","coinex","coinfalcon","coinfield","coinjar","coinmate","coinone","coinsbit","coinspro","cointiger","coinw","coss","crex24","crosstower","cryptocarbon","cryptodotcom","cryptology","cryptopia","cryptsy","cube","currency","dcoin","ddex","decoin","deribit","digifinex","edxmarkets","erisx","etoro","exmo","fastex","fcoin","figuremarkets","flipster","foxbit","ftx","ftxus","garantex","gateio","gemini","globitex","gopax","graviex","hashkey","hitbtc","huobijapan","huobipro","hyperliquid","independentreserve","indodax","indoex","inx","itbit","korbit","kraken","kucoin","kuna","latoken","lbank","liqnet","liquid","litebit","lmax","luno","lykke","mercadobtc","mercatox","mexc","mock","mtgox","ndax","nominex","okcoin","okex","onetrading","osl","oslhongkong","p2pb2b","pancakeswap","paramountdax","paribu","phemex","poloniex","probit","safetrade","sigenpro","therocktrading","tidefi","timex","tokenomy","toobit","tradeogre","uniswap","unocoin","upbit","valr","vitex","wazirx","whitebit","woo","xcoex","xtpub","yellow","yobit","zaif","zbdotcom","zbg","zebitex","zonda"],"x-enum-properties-info":{},"x-visibility-roles-required-enum":{},"minLength":2,"maxLength":30},"example":"coinbase"},{"name":"instrument","in":"query","description":"A mapped and/or unmapped instrument to retrieve for a specific market (you can use either the instrument XXBTZUSD or mapped instrument (base - quote) BTC-USD on kraken as an example).

It's particularly useful for users who need to analyze specific periods of trading activity in granular detail, helping to pinpoint market reactions to events or identify trading patterns at a precise moment in time. It is ideal for users who need to stay up to date with the latest spot trades.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Granular Trade Data**: Access detailed trade information including timestamps with nanosecond precision, transaction values, quantities, and associated markets.\n- **Standardized and Deduplicated Information**: Receive clean, consistent data free from duplicates for accurate cryptocurrency market analysis.\n- **Unique CCSEQ Numbers**: Each trade includes an individual CryptoCompare Sequence (CCSEQ) number for precise tracking and sequencing.\n- **Trade Side Identification**: Determine the buy or sell side of each trade to enhance market sentiment analysis.\n- **Real-Time Data Retrieval**: Obtain data starting from any given timestamp to focus on specific trading periods or events.\n- **Received and Reported Timestamps**: Compare exchange-reported timestamps with data receipt times for comprehensive temporal analysis.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Detailed Trade Analysis**: Examine trade executions at specific moments for forensic market analysis or detailed trade reconstruction.\n- **Event-Driven Strategy Development**: Develop trading strategies that capitalize on market reactions to news or events by studying their immediate impact.\n- **Compliance and Audit Trails**: Utilize detailed transaction records to ensure trading activities meet regulatory standards and provide clear audit trails.\n- **Academic Research**: Conduct studies on market microstructures or trading pattern impacts using precise, timestamped trade data.\n- **Algorithmic Trading Models**: Build and refine algorithmic trading models that depend on high-frequency trade data for backtesting and live trading.\n\n### Target Audiences\n- **Financial Analysts and Market Researchers**: Professionals requiring precise historical data to analyze market trends or validate hypotheses.\n- **Regulatory and Compliance Professionals**: Individuals needing detailed transaction records for monitoring and reporting.\n- **Algorithmic Traders and Quantitative Analysts**: Developers of models dependent on high-frequency cryptocurrency trade data.\n- **Academic Institutions**: Researchers and students studying financial markets who need access to high-resolution data.\n- **Data Scientists**: Professionals working on machine learning models and predictive analytics in financial markets.\n\n### Data Handling Notes\n- **Identifying the First Trade Timestamp**: Use the FIRST_TRADE_SPOT_TIMESTAMP from the [Markets + Instruments](/documentation/data-api/spot_v1_markets_instruments) endpoint to determine the timestamp of the first trade for any given instrument. This establishes the starting point of your data analysis, ensuring a complete history from inception. This is the only scenario where you should not include the last_ccseq parameter in your request.\n- **Handling Identical Timestamps in Pagination**: If all returned trades share the same timestamp, refine your pagination by including both the timestamp of the last trade in the after_ts parameter and its CCSEQ in the last_ccseq parameter. Always adding last_ccseq in your requests ensures seamless pagination without missing any trades.\n- **Skipping Invalid Messages**: To maintain data accuracy, there are instances where trades may be marked as INVALID due to exchange API errors or data processing issues. You can set the skip_invalid_messages parameter to true to omit these invalid trades. However, this will result in gaps in CCSEQ numbers, making it harder to confirm the receipt of all trades. For comprehensive data, we recommend not skipping invalid messages.\n- **Efficient Data Backfilling**: While this endpoint is ideal for staying up to date with the latest spot trades, it is not efficient for backfilling historical data or catching up on multiple days of missed trades. For backfilling, use the [Trades Full Hour Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/spot_v2_historical_trades_hour) instead. This endpoint stores trades in hourly batches, which can contain up to 5 million trades per hour. Using the real-time endpoint for backfilling is inefficient, as it would require downloading large volumes of data only to use a fraction of it.\n- **Managing Timeouts from High Volumes of Invalidated Trades**: In cases where exchanges send large volumes of invalid trades — sometimes reaching millions — timeouts can occur as the system searches through numerous blob files before locating valid entries. To prevent these delays, set skip_invalid_messages to false, enabling the endpoint to return both valid and invalid trades. This approach avoids skipping over invalid trades and allows for smoother data retrieval. Paginate results based on the timestamp and CCSEQ of the last invalid trade to maintain continuity without missing data or encountering further timeouts.\n\nBy leveraging this endpoint, users gain access to high-resolution trade data essential for precise market analysis, application development, and strategic planning in the dynamic cryptocurrency trading environment.","tags":["Spot"],"operationId":"spot_v2_historical_trades","x-section":"Spot","x-subsection":"Trade","x-roles-required":["free","premium"],"x-cache-length-seconds":10,"x-visible-in-ai":false,"x-endpoint-group-id":"spot_v1_historical_trade","x-endpoint-group-name":"Trades","parameters":[{"name":"market","in":"query","description":"The exchange to obtain data from","required":true,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"string","enum":["aax","abcc","acx","aidosmarket","alphaex","archax","ascendex","ataix","backpack","bequant","bgogo","bibox365","bigone","bilaxy","binance","binanceaggregate","binanceusa","bingx","bisq","bit","bit2c","bit2me","bitbank","bitbay","bitbns","bitbuy","bitci","bitexbook","bitfex","bitfinex","bitflyer","bitflyereu","bitflyerfx","bitflyerus","bitforex","bitget","bithumbglobal","bithumbkorea","bitinka","bitkub","bitmart","bitmex","bitopro","bitpanda","bitrue","bitso","bitstamp","bittrex","bitunix","bitvavo","bkex","blackturtle","bleutrade","blockchaincom","btcalpha","btcbox","btcex","btcmarkets","btcturk","btse","buda","bullish","buyucoin","bwexchange","bybit","bydfi","catex","cexio","coinbase","coinbaseinternational","coincheck","coincorner","coindcx","coindeal","coinex","coinfalcon","coinfield","coinjar","coinmate","coinone","coinsbit","coinspro","cointiger","coinw","coss","crex24","crosstower","cryptocarbon","cryptodotcom","cryptology","cryptopia","cryptsy","cube","currency","dcoin","ddex","decoin","deribit","digifinex","edxmarkets","erisx","etoro","exmo","fastex","fcoin","figuremarkets","flipster","foxbit","ftx","ftxus","garantex","gateio","gemini","globitex","gopax","graviex","hashkey","hitbtc","huobijapan","huobipro","hyperliquid","independentreserve","indodax","indoex","inx","itbit","korbit","kraken","kucoin","kuna","latoken","lbank","liqnet","liquid","litebit","lmax","luno","lykke","mercadobtc","mercatox","mexc","mock","mtgox","ndax","nominex","okcoin","okex","onetrading","osl","oslhongkong","p2pb2b","pancakeswap","paramountdax","paribu","phemex","poloniex","probit","safetrade","sigenpro","therocktrading","tidefi","timex","tokenomy","toobit","tradeogre","uniswap","unocoin","upbit","valr","vitex","wazirx","whitebit","woo","xcoex","xtpub","yellow","yobit","zaif","zbdotcom","zbg","zebitex","zonda"],"x-enum-properties-info":{},"x-visibility-roles-required-enum":{},"minLength":2,"maxLength":30},"example":"coinbase"},{"name":"instrument","in":"query","description":"A mapped and/or unmapped instrument to retrieve for a specific market (you can use either the instrument XXBTZUSD or mapped instrument (base - quote) BTC-USD on kraken as an example).

This powerful tool is essential for users needing detailed historical trade information and is equally valuable for capturing the latest trades as soon as they occur on futures exchanges. The endpoint's versatility makes it ideal for a variety of professional needs including detailed post-trade analysis, real-time trading strategy adjustment, compliance auditing, and algorithm testing, where both historical and the most current transaction details are crucial.","x-extended-description-with-markdown":"The Futures Trades By Timestamp Endpoint delivers tick-level trade data, documenting every executed transaction for a specified futures instrument on a chosen exchange, starting from a designated timestamp. This powerful tool is essential for users needing detailed historical trade information and is equally valuable for capturing the latest trades as soon as they occur on futures exchanges. The endpoint's versatility makes it ideal for a variety of professional needs including detailed post-trade analysis, real-time trading strategy adjustment, compliance auditing, and algorithm testing, where both historical and the most current transaction details are crucial.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Real-time Market Monitoring**: Enables traders to receive up-to-the-minute trading data, allowing them to react swiftly to market movements and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n- **Historical Market Reconstruction**: Analysts and traders can use this endpoint to reconstruct market activity from a specific point in time, understanding the market dynamics that influenced trading decisions.\n- **Algorithm Testing and Optimization**: Provides quantitative analysts with precise historical and real-time data to test, refine, and implement trading algorithms.\n- **Compliance and Auditing**: Critical for compliance officers who need to ensure trading activities conform to regulations, offering an accurate record of all transactions from a specific timestamp onwards.\n- **Academic and Financial Research**: Enables thorough analysis of market trends and trader behavior by providing detailed transaction data starting from significant market events or periods.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **Day Traders and Intraday Traders**: Professionals who rely on immediate data feeds to inform their trading decisions and maximize profitability.\n- **Quantitative Analysts and Algorithmic Traders**: Those who develop and adjust high-frequency trading models that require real-time and historical trade data.\n- **Compliance Officers and Regulatory Auditors**: Professionals tasked with verifying trading records against market regulations and standards.\n- **Market Researchers and Financial Historians**: Analysts interested in detailed transaction data for studies on market dynamics and trading patterns.\n\n### Data Handling Notes:\n- **Identifying the First Trade Timestamp**: To accurately determine the timestamp of the first trade for any given instrument, utilize the FIRST_TRADE_FUTURES_TIMESTAMP provided by the Markets + Instruments endpoint. This value is essential for establishing the starting point of your data analysis and ensuring that you capture the complete history of trading activity from the onset. **This is the only time you should not be adding the last_ccseq parameter in your request**.\n- **Handling Identical Timestamps in Pagination**: In cases where all trades returned have the same timestamp, it's crucial to refine your pagination strategy to continue data retrieval efficiently. Always include both the timestamp of the last trade in the after_ts parameter and the CCSEQ of that trade in the last_ccseq parameter when paginating. **We strongly recommend always adding last_ccseq in your requests**, as this ensures that pagination proceeds without missing any trades, capturing every transaction accurately for your analysis.\n- **Skipping Invalid Trades**: To maintain data accuracy, there are instances where trades may be marked as INVALID due to exchange API errors or data processing issues. You can set the skip_invalid_messages parameter to true to omit these invalid trades. However, this will result in gaps in CCSEQ numbers, making it harder to confirm the receipt of all trades. For comprehensive data, we recommend not skipping invalid trades.\n- **Efficient Data Backfilling**: While this endpoint is ideal for staying up to date with the latest trades, it is not efficient for backfilling historical data or catching up on multiple days of missed trades. For backfilling, use the [Trades Full Hour Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/futures_v2_historical_trades_hour) instead. This endpoint stores trades in hourly batches, which can contain up to 5 million trades per hour. Using the real-time endpoint for backfilling is inefficient, as it would require downloading large volumes of data only to use a fraction of it.\n\nThe Futures Trades By Timestamp Endpoint is a critical resource for a wide range of financial professionals. By delivering both historical and real-time transaction data with tick-level precision, this endpoint ensures users can track market activity comprehensively from any specified point, making it an invaluable tool for risk management, strategy development, compliance monitoring, and market research. Whether the goal is to capture the latest market changes as they happen or to analyze past trading activities for deeper insights, this tool provides the essential data necessary to navigate the complexities of the futures markets effectively.","tags":["Futures"],"operationId":"futures_v2_historical_trades","x-section":"Futures","x-roles-required":["free","premium"],"x-cache-length-seconds":10,"x-visible-in-ai":false,"x-endpoint-group-id":"futures_v1_historical_trade","x-endpoint-group-name":"Trades","parameters":[{"name":"market","in":"query","description":"The exchange to obtain data from","required":true,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"string","enum":["binance","bit","bitfinex","bitget","bitmex","btcex","bullish","bybit","coinbase","coinbaseinternational","crosstower","cryptodotcom","deribit","dydxv4","ftx","gateio","huobipro","hyperliquid","kraken","kucoin","mock","okex"],"x-enum-properties-info":{},"x-visibility-roles-required-enum":{},"minLength":2,"maxLength":30},"example":"bitmex"},{"name":"instrument","in":"query","description":"A mapped and/or unmapped instrument to retrieve for a specific market (you can use either the instrument XXBTZUSD or mapped instrument (base - quote) BTC-USD on kraken as an example).

This endpoint is invaluable for users requiring precise and timestamped data on open interest to analyze shifts in market depth, trader commitments, and sentiment over specific periods.

It supports a range of financial activities, from strategic trading and risk management to regulatory compliance and market research, by offering direct insights into the dynamics of open interest as they unfold.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Strategic Trading Decisions**: Traders can utilize real-time updates on open interest to make informed decisions, adjusting their strategies based on the latest market dynamics.\n- **Comprehensive Market Analysis**: Provides analysts with precise, timestamped data to track and understand the fluctuations in open interest, aiding in the assessment of market sentiment and liquidity.\n- **Risk Management**: Helps risk managers monitor changes in market exposure and adjust their strategies swiftly to mitigate associated risks.\n- **Regulatory Compliance and Auditing**: Essential for compliance officers who need to ensure that all trading activities involving futures contracts adhere to industry regulations, using exact timestamps for detailed auditing.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **Futures Traders**: Professionals who depend on detailed and up-to-date information about open interest for optimizing their trading tactics.\n- **Market Analysts**: Analysts looking for granular data to analyze market conditions and validate their market predictions.\n- **Risk Managers**: Those responsible for monitoring and managing the risks associated with volatile futures markets.\n- **Regulatory Compliance Officers**: Compliance professionals who require accurate, timestamped records of open interest for reporting and regulatory checks.\n\n### Data Handling Notes:\n- **Identifying the First Update Timestamp**: To accurately determine the timestamp of the first update for any given instrument, utilize the FIRST_OPEN_INTEREST_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP provided by the Markets + Instruments endpoint. This value is essential for establishing the starting point of your data analysis and ensuring that you capture the complete history of trading activity from the onset. **This is the only time you should not be adding the last_ccseq parameter in your request**.\n- **Handling Identical Timestamps in Pagination**: In cases where all updates returned have the same timestamp, it's crucial to refine your pagination strategy to continue data retrieval efficiently. Always include both the timestamp of the last update in the after_ts parameter and the CCSEQ of that update in the last_ccseq parameter when paginating. **We strongly recommend always adding last_ccseq in your requests**, as this ensures that pagination proceeds without missing any updates, capturing every transaction accurately for your analysis.\n- **Skipping Invalid Updates**: To maintain data accuracy, there are instances where updates may be marked as INVALID due to exchange API errors or data processing issues. You can set the skip_invalid_messages parameter to true to omit these invalid updates. However, this will result in gaps in CCSEQ numbers, making it harder to confirm the receipt of all updates. For comprehensive data, we recommend not skipping invalid updates.\n- **Efficient Data Backfilling**: While this endpoint is ideal for staying up to date with the latest updates, it is not efficient for backfilling historical data or catching up on multiple days of missed updates. For backfilling, use the [Futures Open Interest Updates Full Hour Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/futures_v2_historical_open_interest_messages_hour) instead. This endpoint stores updates in hourly batches, which can contain up to 5 million updates per hour. Using the real-time endpoint for backfilling is inefficient, as it would require downloading large volumes of data only to use a fraction of it.\n\nThe Futures Message Updates Open Interest by Timestamp endpoint is a critical tool for anyone involved in the futures markets requiring access to real-time, detailed updates on open interest from a specific point in time. This endpoint delivers the necessary granularity for rigorous analysis, strategic decision-making, and compliance, ensuring that users can act on the most current data available and maintain compliance with market standards.

Funding rates, critical in perpetual futures contracts, indicate the periodic payments exchanged between buyers and sellers and are essential indicators of market sentiment and leverage. This data is invaluable for users who need detailed insights into funding rate changes over time, enabling them to make informed decisions in trading, risk management, and market analysis.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Real-Time Strategy Adjustment**: Traders can use up-to-the-minute funding rate data to adjust their trading strategies in real-time, responding quickly to changes that could affect the profitability of their positions.\n- **Historical Analysis and Backtesting**: Provides quantitative analysts and traders with historical funding rate data from specific starting points, crucial for backtesting trading models and strategies against historical conditions.\n- **Risk Management**: Helps risk managers assess and respond to the risks associated with funding rate fluctuations, using precise data to mitigate potential impacts on trading operations.\n- **Market Research**: Enables financial researchers to study the effects of funding rates on market dynamics, particularly in the context of perpetual futures, providing a deeper understanding of how these rates influence market behavior over time.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **Perpetual Futures Traders**: Professionals who trade perpetual futures contracts and rely on detailed, timestamp-specific funding rate updates to guide their trading decisions.\n- **Quantitative Analysts**: Analysts who require granular funding rate data for developing and refining predictive models and trading algorithms.\n- **Risk Managers**: Individuals tasked with managing the financial risks associated with funding rate volatility in perpetual futures markets.\n- **Academic Researchers**: Academics and financial market researchers studying the impact of funding rates on long-term market trends and trading strategies.\n\n### Data Handling Notes:\n- **Identifying the First Update Timestamp**: To accurately determine the timestamp of the first update for any given instrument, utilize the FIRST_FUNDING_RATE_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP provided by the Markets + Instruments endpoint. This value is essential for establishing the starting point of your data analysis and ensuring that you capture the complete history of trading activity from the onset. **This is the only time you should not be adding the last_ccseq parameter in your request**.\n- **Handling Identical Timestamps in Pagination**: In cases where all updates returned have the same timestamp, it's crucial to refine your pagination strategy to continue data retrieval efficiently. Always include both the timestamp of the last update in the after_ts parameter and the CCSEQ of that update in the last_ccseq parameter when paginating. **We strongly recommend always adding last_ccseq in your requests**, as this ensures that pagination proceeds without missing any updates, capturing every transaction accurately for your analysis.\n- **Skipping Invalid Updates**: To maintain data accuracy, there are instances where updates may be marked as INVALID due to exchange API errors or data processing issues. You can set the skip_invalid_messages parameter to true to omit these invalid updates. However, this will result in gaps in CCSEQ numbers, making it harder to confirm the receipt of all updates. For comprehensive data, we recommend not skipping invalid updates.\n- **Efficient Data Backfilling**: While this endpoint is ideal for staying up to date with the latest updates, it is not efficient for backfilling historical data or catching up on multiple days of missed updates. For backfilling, use the [Funding Rates Updates Full Hour Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/futures_v2_historical_funding_rate_messages_hour) instead. This endpoint stores updates in hourly batches, which can contain up to 5 million updates per hour. Using the real-time endpoint for backfilling is inefficient, as it would require downloading large volumes of data only to use a fraction of it.\n\nThe Futures Message Updates Funding Rate by Timestamp endpoint is a crucial tool for anyone involved in trading or analyzing perpetual futures markets. By providing detailed funding rate updates from a designated timestamp, this endpoint ensures that financial professionals have access to the precise data needed for a wide range of activities, including real-time trading adjustments, comprehensive risk management, and in-depth market research.

The denomination type captures the settlement mechanics: VANILLA contracts settle in the quote currency (linear), INVERSE contracts settle in the underlying asset (common for BTC/ETH perpetuals), and QUANTO contracts settle in a third currency for cross-currency exposure.\nExpiration encoding handles both perpetual contracts (PERPETUAL for `contract_expiration_ts = -1`) and dated futures (YYYYMMDD format). Examples include `ETH-USD-INVERSE-PERPETUAL` for inverse perpetuals settled in ETH, `BTC-USD-VANILLA-20240329` for linear quarterly contracts settled in USD, and `ETH-USD-QUANTO-PERPETUAL` for quanto perpetuals with alternative settlement currencies.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Derivatives Infrastructure**: Build normalized futures data feeds with consistent contract identification across all major derivatives exchanges, handling complex denomination logic and expiration cycles.\n- **Risk Management Systems**: Implement precise position tracking and exposure calculation using standardized contract specifications, settlement currencies, and leverage ratios.\n- **Cross-Exchange Arbitrage**: Enable systematic price comparison and spread analysis across venues using canonical contract mapping and real-time operational status.\n- **Quantitative Research**: Access clean, categorized derivatives data for volatility surface modeling, basis analysis, and cross-asset derivatives strategies.\n- **Portfolio Analytics**: Track futures positions with accurate P&L calculation using correct settlement currencies, contract multipliers, and mark-to-market logic.\n- **Trading Platform Integration**: Implement multi-venue derivatives trading with unified contract reference, order routing, and position reconciliation.\n- **Market Making Operations**: Deploy systematic liquidity provision across exchanges using standardized contract metadata and operational integration context.\n- **Regulatory Reporting**: Generate compliant derivatives exposure reports using canonical instrument identification and complete contract specifications.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **Derivatives Trading Firms**: Systematic traders requiring normalized contract data for multi-venue algorithmic strategies and cross-exchange position management.\n- **Risk Management Teams**: Portfolio managers needing accurate futures exposure calculation, margin requirements, and settlement currency tracking across venues.\n- **Quantitative Developers**: Engineers building derivatives data infrastructure, volatility models, and systematic trading systems requiring clean contract mapping.\n- **Institutional Asset Managers**: Portfolio construction teams incorporating crypto derivatives with precise risk metrics and standardized position tracking.\n- **Market Data Vendors**: Data providers needing canonical futures reference data for client feeds, index calculation, and normalized market data products.\n- **Compliance & Operations**: Teams managing derivatives trading operations, regulatory reporting, and cross-venue position reconciliation workflows.\n- **Trading Infrastructure Engineers**: Backend developers building low-latency derivatives trading systems with deterministic contract identification and routing logic.","tags":["Futures"],"operationId":"futures_v1_markets_instruments","x-section":"Futures","x-roles-required":[],"x-cache-length-seconds":60,"x-visible-in-ai":false,"x-endpoint-group-id":"futures_v1_markets_instrument","x-endpoint-group-name":"Markets + Instruments","parameters":[{"name":"market","in":"query","description":"The exchange to obtain data from","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"string","default":"","enum":["binance","bit","bitfinex","bitget","bitmex","btcex","bullish","bybit","coinbase","coinbaseinternational","crosstower","cryptodotcom","deribit","dydxv4","ftx","gateio","huobipro","hyperliquid","kraken","kucoin","mock","okex",""],"x-enum-properties-info":{},"x-visibility-roles-required-enum":{},"minLength":0,"maxLength":30},"example":"kraken"},{"name":"instruments","in":"query","description":"The mapped instruments to retrieve on a specific market or all available markets.","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"array","default":[],"minItems":0,"maxItems":25,"items":{"type":"string"}},"example":["BTC-USD-INVERSE-PERPETUAL","ETH-USD-INVERSE-PERPETUAL"]},{"name":"instrument_status","in":"query","description":"The instrument_status field represents the current state of an instrument, indicating whether it is actively traded (ACTIVE), excluded from use (IGNORED), no longer active but retained for historical purposes (RETIRED), no longer valid due to expiration (EXPIRED), or in a transitional phase for removal (READY_FOR_DECOMMISSIONING).","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"array","default":["ACTIVE"],"items":{"type":"string","enum":["ACTIVE","IGNORED","RETIRED","EXPIRED","READY_FOR_DECOMMISSIONING","RETIRED_UNMAPPED"],"x-enum-properties-info":{}}},"example":["ACTIVE"]},{"name":"groups","in":"query","description":"When requesting market metadata entries you can filter by specific groups of interest.

It is particularly useful for users who need to analyze specific periods of options trading activity in granular detail, helping to pinpoint market reactions to events or identify trading patterns at precise moments. It is ideal for users who need to stay up to date with the latest options trades.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Granular Options Trade Data:**: Access detailed options trade information, including timestamps with nanosecond precision, premium values, contract sizes, and option types (put/call).\n- **Standardized and Deduplicated Information**: Receive clean, consistent data free from duplicates for accurate cryptocurrency options market analysis..\n- **Unique CCSEQ Numbers:**: Each options trade includes an individual CryptoCompare Sequence (CCSEQ) number for precise tracking and sequencing.\n- **Trade Side Identification**: Determine the buy or sell side of each options trade to enhance market sentiment analysis..\n- **Real-Time Data Retrieval**: Obtain data starting from any given timestamp to focus on specific trading periods or events in the options market.\n- **Received and Reported Timestamps**: Compare exchange-reported timestamps with data receipt times for comprehensive temporal analysis.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Detailed Options Trade Analysis**: Examine options trade executions at specific moments for forensic market analysis or detailed trade reconstruction..\n- **Event-Driven Strategy Development**: Develop trading strategies that capitalize on market reactions to news or events by studying their immediate impact on options markets.\n- **Compliance and Audit Trails**: Utilize detailed transaction records to ensure options trading activities meet regulatory standards and provide clear audit trails.\n- **Academic Research**: Conduct studies on market microstructures or options trading pattern impacts using precise, timestamped trade data.\n- **Algorithmic Trading Models**: Build and refine algorithmic trading models that depend on high-frequency options trade data for backtesting and live trading.\n\n### Target Audiences\n- **Financial Analysts and Market Researchers**: Professionals requiring precise historical data to analyze market trends or validate hypotheses.\n- **Regulatory and Compliance Professionals**: Individuals needing detailed transaction records for monitoring and reporting.\n- **Algorithmic Traders and Quantitative Analysts**: Developers of models dependent on high-frequency cryptocurrency trade data.\n- **Academic Institutions**: Researchers and students studying financial markets who need access to high-resolution data.\n- **Data Scientists**: Professionals working on machine learning models and predictive analytics in financial markets.\n\n### Data Handling Notes\n- **Identifying the First Trade Timestamp**: Use the FIRST_TRADE_OPTIONS_TIMESTAMP from the [Markets + Instruments](/documentation/data-api/options_v1_markets_instruments) endpoint to determine the timestamp of the first trade for any given instrument. This establishes the starting point of your data analysis, ensuring a complete history from inception. This is the only scenario where you should not include the last_ccseq parameter in your request.\n- **Handling Identical Timestamps in Pagination**: If all returned trades share the same timestamp, refine your pagination by including both the timestamp of the last trade in the after_ts parameter and its CCSEQ in the last_ccseq parameter. Always adding last_ccseq in your requests ensures seamless pagination without missing any trades.\n- **Skipping Invalid Messages**: To maintain data accuracy, there are instances where trades may be marked as INVALID due to exchange API errors or data processing issues. You can set the skip_invalid_messages parameter to true to omit these invalid trades. However, this will result in gaps in CCSEQ numbers, making it harder to confirm the receipt of all trades. For comprehensive data, we recommend not skipping invalid messages.\n- **Efficient Data Backfilling**: While this endpoint is ideal for staying up to date with the latest options trades, it is not efficient for backfilling historical data or catching up on multiple days of missed trades. For backfilling, use the [Trades Full Hour Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/options_v2_historical_trades_hour) instead. This endpoint stores trades in hourly batches, which can contain up to 5 million trades per hour. Using the real-time endpoint for backfilling is inefficient, as it would require downloading large volumes of data only to use a fraction of it.\n- **Managing Timeouts from High Volumes of Invalidated Trades**: In cases where exchanges send large volumes of invalid trades — sometimes reaching millions — timeouts can occur as the system searches through numerous blob files before locating valid entries. To prevent these delays, set skip_invalid_messages to false, enabling the endpoint to return both valid and invalid trades. This approach avoids skipping over invalid trades and allows for smoother data retrieval. Paginate results based on the timestamp and CCSEQ of the last invalid trade to maintain continuity without missing data or encountering further timeouts.\n\nBy leveraging this endpoint, users gain access to high-resolution trade data essential for precise market analysis, application development, and strategic planning in the dynamic cryptocurrency trading environment.","tags":["Options"],"operationId":"options_v2_historical_trades","x-section":"Options","x-subsection":"Trade","x-roles-required":["free","premium"],"x-cache-length-seconds":10,"x-visible-in-ai":false,"x-endpoint-group-id":"options_v1_historical_trade","x-endpoint-group-name":"Trades","parameters":[{"name":"market","in":"query","required":true,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"string","enum":["binance","deribit","okex"],"x-enum-properties-info":{},"x-visibility-roles-required-enum":{},"minLength":2,"maxLength":30},"example":"okex"},{"name":"instrument","in":"query","required":true,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"string","minLength":1,"maxLength":500},"example":"BTC-USD-20241227-15000-P"},{"name":"groups","in":"query","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"array","default":["ID","MAPPING","TRADE"],"items":{"type":"string","enum":["ID","MAPPING","MAPPING_ADVANCED","TRADE","STATUS"],"x-enum-properties-info":{}}},"example":[]},{"name":"after_ts","in":"query","required":true,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"x-is-timestamp":true},"example":1721869200},{"name":"last_ccseq","in":"query","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"integer","default":0,"minimum":0},"example":0},{"name":"limit","in":"query","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"integer","default":100,"minimum":1,"maximum":5000},"example":100},{"name":"apply_mapping","in":"query","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"boolean","default":true},"example":true},{"name":"response_format","in":"query","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"string","default":"JSON","enum":["JSON","CSV"],"x-enum-properties-info":{"JSON":{"name":"JSON","description":"Data is returned in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format for easy parsing and integration."},"CSV":{"name":"CSV","description":"Data is returned in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format for spreadsheet and tabular analysis."}}},"example":"JSON"},{"name":"skip_invalid_messages","in":"query","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"boolean","default":false},"example":false}],"deprecated":false,"responses":{"200":{"description":"Success response from the API.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/OPTIONS_INSTRUMENT_TRADE_RESPONSE"}}}},"400":{"description":"The 400 error occurs when some of the data sent is malformed.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ERROR_DATA_ARRAY"}}}},"401":{"description":"The 401 error occurs when you don't use a valid API Key on an endpoint that requires authentication.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ERROR_DATA_ARRAY"}}}},"403":{"description":"The 403 error occurs when you don't use a valid API Key on an endpoint that requires authentication.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ERROR_DATA_ARRAY"}}}},"404":{"description":"The 404 error can either be returned when some/all of parameters sent are not found within our system.

This API endpoint delivers comprehensive and detailed open interest data, including individual message updates with associated timestamps. It is essential for users who need to stay up to date with the latest open interest changes and analyze real-time data to make informed trading and investment decisions.","x-extended-description-with-markdown":"The Options Open Interest Message Updates By Timestamp endpoint provides real-time updates on open interest for specified options instruments on a chosen exchange, starting from a specified timestamp. This API endpoint delivers comprehensive and detailed open interest data, including individual message updates with associated timestamps. It is essential for users who need to stay up to date with the latest open interest changes and analyze real-time data to make informed trading and investment decisions.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Real-Time Market Monitoring**: Enables traders and analysts to stay up to date with the latest open interest updates, facilitating timely and informed trading decisions.\n- **Strategy Development and Adjustment**: Supports traders in developing, refining, and adjusting trading strategies using real-time open interest data.\n- **Market Research and Reporting**: Provides essential data for ongoing market research and generating real-time reports on open interest trends.\n- **Risk Management**: Assists risk managers in monitoring real-time changes in open interest to assess and mitigate risk exposure effectively.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **Options Traders**: Professionals who require up-to-the-minute open interest updates to make prompt and informed trading decisions.\n- **Financial Analysts**: Professionals who analyze real-time open interest data to monitor trends and perform continuous market analysis.\n- **Algorithmic Traders and Developers**: Utilize real-time open interest data to implement and refine automated trading strategies.\n- **Risk Managers**: Individuals focused on monitoring and mitigating risks using the latest open interest updates to manage market exposure.\n\n### Data Handling Notes\n- **Identifying the First Message Timestamp**: Use the FIRST_OPEN_INTEREST_OPTIONS_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP from the [Markets + Instruments](/documentation/data-api/options_v1_markets_instruments) endpoint to determine the timestamp of the first message for any given instrument. This establishes the starting point of your data analysis, ensuring a complete history from inception. This is the only scenario where you should not include the last_ccseq parameter in your request.\n- **Handling Identical Timestamps in Pagination**: If all returned messages share the same timestamp, refine your pagination by including both the timestamp of the last message in the after_ts parameter and its CCSEQ in the last_ccseq parameter. Always adding last_ccseq in your requests ensures seamless pagination without missing any messages.\n- **Skipping Invalid Messages**: To maintain data accuracy, there are instances where messages may be marked as INVALID due to exchange API errors or data processing issues. You can set the skip_invalid_messages parameter to true to omit these invalid messages. However, this will result in gaps in CCSEQ numbers, making it harder to confirm the receipt of all messages. For comprehensive data, we recommend not skipping invalid messages.\n- **Efficient Data Backfilling**: While this endpoint is ideal for staying up to date with the latest options messages, it is not efficient for backfilling historical data or catching up on multiple days of missed messages. For backfilling, use the [Updates (OI) Full Hour](/documentation/data-api/options_v2_historical_open_interest_messages_hour) instead. This endpoint stores messages in hourly batches, which can contain up to 5 million messages per hour. Using the real-time endpoint for backfilling is inefficient, as it would require downloading large volumes of data only to use a fraction of it.\n- **Handling Timeouts Due to Invalidated Messages**: Timeouts may occur because the system is parsing through a large number of blob files with invalidated messages before finding valid ones. To avoid this, set the skip_invalid_messages parameter to false, which allows the endpoint to return both valid and invalid messages. This will prevent the system from skipping over invalid messages, thereby avoiding unnecessary delays. You can then paginate the data using the timestamp and CCSEQ of the last invalid message, ensuring that the process continues without missing any messages or experiencing further timeouts.\n\nThis endpoint is an invaluable tool for accessing real-time open interest updates for specified options instruments on a chosen exchange, starting from a specified timestamp. It ensures comprehensive and accurate real-time analysis, facilitating informed trading decisions and optimized trading strategies.","tags":["Options"],"operationId":"options_v2_historical_open_interest_messages","x-section":"Options","x-roles-required":["free","premium"],"x-cache-length-seconds":10,"x-visible-in-ai":false,"x-endpoint-group-id":"options_v1_historical_open_interest_message","x-endpoint-group-name":"Updates (OI)","parameters":[{"name":"market","in":"query","description":"The exchange to obtain data from","required":true,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"string","enum":["binance","deribit","okex"],"x-enum-properties-info":{},"x-visibility-roles-required-enum":{},"minLength":2,"maxLength":30},"example":"deribit"},{"name":"instrument","in":"query","description":"A mapped and/or unmapped instrument to retrieve for a specific market (you can use either the instrument XXBTZUSD or mapped instrument (base - quote) BTC-USD on kraken as an example).

Each entry in the dictionary uses the instrument ID—standardized by our mapping team—as the key, ensuring consistency and ease of reference.","x-extended-description-with-markdown":"This endpoint retrieves a comprehensive dictionary of mapped options trading instruments across derivatives exchanges using a standardized house record methodology. Options are grouped by underlying asset, strike currency, and expiration date into unified house records, with individual put/call instruments at different strike prices mapped under each record. This approach enables systematic options chain management and cross-venue normalization of complex derivatives structures. You can learn more about our [mapping methodology in this blog post](https://data.coindesk.com/blogs/mapping-dominance-why-it-matters-and-how-we-do-it).\n\nThe unified options mapping schema handles the complexity of options contracts through house record grouping and standardized strike/expiration encoding, providing integration-ready metadata for building robust options data infrastructure and volatility surface construction.\n\n### Options Mapping Methodology\nThis endpoint uses a house record approach where multiple options instruments sharing the same underlying asset, strike currency, and expiration date are grouped under a unified record identifier. Individual options are then mapped using the canonical format `{UNDERLYING_CURRENCY}-{STRIKE_CURRENCY}-{EXPIRY_YYYYMMDD}-{STRIKE_PRICE}-{PUT_OR_CALL}` where PUT_OR_CALL is represented as 'P' for puts and 'C' for calls.\nThe house record structure captures common contract specifications (settlement currency, option style, index underlying) while individual instruments differentiate by strike price and option type. Examples include `BTC-USD-20230630-31000-P` for a Bitcoin put option struck at $31,000 expiring June 30, 2023, and `ETH-USD-20230309-1800-C` for an Ethereum call option struck at $1,800 expiring March 9, 2023.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Options Chain Management**: Build normalized options data feeds with systematic chain organization, enabling efficient volatility surface construction and Greeks calculation across multiple exchanges.\n- **Volatility Trading Systems**: Implement systematic volatility strategies using standardized options mapping, strike clustering, and expiration cycle management for cross-venue arbitrage opportunities.\n- **Risk Management Platforms**: Track complex options portfolios with accurate position attribution, Greeks aggregation, and exposure calculation using unified house record methodology.\n- **Market Making Operations**: Deploy systematic liquidity provision across options markets using standardized contract identification, delta hedging, and inventory management systems.\n- **Quantitative Research**: Access clean options data for volatility surface modeling, skew analysis, and cross-asset derivatives research with consistent strike and expiration encoding.\n- **Portfolio Analytics**: Calculate precise options P&L, Greeks exposure, and risk metrics using correct underlying references, settlement currencies, and contract specifications.\n- **Trading Platform Integration**: Implement multi-venue options trading with unified contract reference, order routing, and position reconciliation across different exchange formats.\n- **Regulatory Reporting**: Generate compliant options exposure reports using canonical instrument identification and complete contract specifications for derivatives oversight.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **Options Trading Firms**: Systematic volatility traders requiring normalized options chain data for multi-venue algorithmic strategies and cross-exchange position management.\n- **Volatility Researchers**: Quantitative analysts building volatility models, surface construction algorithms, and options pricing systems requiring clean contract mapping.\n- **Risk Management Teams**: Portfolio managers needing accurate options exposure calculation, Greeks aggregation, and volatility risk tracking across venues and underlying assets.\n- **Market Data Vendors**: Data providers needing canonical options reference data for client feeds, volatility index calculation, and normalized derivatives products.\n- **Institutional Asset Managers**: Portfolio construction teams incorporating crypto options with precise Greeks exposure, volatility overlay strategies, and risk-adjusted returns.\n- **Trading Infrastructure Engineers**: Backend developers building low-latency options trading systems with deterministic contract identification, chain management, and Greeks calculation.\n- **Compliance & Operations**: Teams managing options trading operations, regulatory reporting, and cross-venue position reconciliation for complex derivatives portfolios.","tags":["Options"],"operationId":"options_v1_markets_instruments","x-section":"Options","x-roles-required":[],"x-cache-length-seconds":60,"x-visible-in-ai":false,"x-endpoint-group-id":"options_v1_markets_instrument","x-endpoint-group-name":"Markets + Instruments","parameters":[{"name":"market","in":"query","description":"The exchange to obtain data from","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"string","default":"","enum":["binance","deribit","okex",""],"x-enum-properties-info":{},"x-visibility-roles-required-enum":{},"minLength":0,"maxLength":30},"example":"deribit"},{"name":"instruments","in":"query","description":"The mapped instruments to retrieve on a specific market or all available markets.","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"array","default":[],"minItems":0,"maxItems":25,"items":{"type":"string"}},"example":["ETH-USD-20250328-4800-P"]},{"name":"instrument_status","in":"query","description":"The instrument_status field represents the current state of an instrument, indicating whether it is actively traded (ACTIVE), excluded from use (IGNORED), no longer active but retained for historical purposes (RETIRED), no longer valid due to expiration (EXPIRED), or in a transitional phase for removal (READY_FOR_DECOMMISSIONING).","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"array","default":["ACTIVE"],"items":{"type":"string","enum":["ACTIVE","IGNORED","RETIRED","EXPIRED","READY_FOR_DECOMMISSIONING","RETIRED_UNMAPPED"],"x-enum-properties-info":{}}},"example":["ACTIVE"]},{"name":"groups","in":"query","description":"When requesting market metadata entries you can filter by specific groups of interest.

For users who need to catch up with all messages since the index started being calculated, it is more efficient to use the /index/v1/historical/messages/hour endpoint.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Historical Data Retrieval**: Enables users to fetch tick-level index data starting from a specific timestamp, ensuring access to all necessary historical updates.\n- **Real-Time Market Monitoring**: Provides traders and analysts with the ability to receive the most recent tick-level data from a specified start point, staying updated with current market conditions.\n- **Detailed Market Analysis**: Assists financial analysts in performing precise market analysis using every available update from a specified timestamp.\n- **Backtesting and Strategy Development**: Supports traders in backtesting and refining trading strategies by providing granular tick-level data from a chosen start time.\n- **Data Integration and Syncing**: Facilitates the integration and syncing of detailed historical and real-time index data into financial systems and databases from a specific point in time.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **Traders and Market Participants**: Individuals who need to catch up on detailed historical tick-level data and stay updated with the latest market information starting from a specific timestamp.\n- **Financial Analysts**: Professionals who analyze market trends and perform in-depth research using both historical and real-time data from a specified start point.\n- **System Integrators and IT Professionals**: Users who integrate detailed historical and real-time index data into financial systems and ensure data synchronization starting from a particular timestamp.\n- **Algorithmic Traders**: Developers and traders who backtest and refine trading algorithms using granular tick-level data from a specified start time and the latest updates.\n\n### Data Handling Notes:\n- **Identifying the First Update Timestamp**: To accurately determine the timestamp of the first update for any given instrument, utilize the FIRST_INDEX_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP provided by the Markets + Instruments endpoint. This value is essential for establishing the starting point of your data analysis and ensuring that you capture the complete history of trading activity from the onset. **This is the only time you should not be adding the last_ccseq parameter in your request**.\n- **Handling Identical Timestamps in Pagination**: If all returned index updates share the same timestamp, refine your pagination by including both the timestamp of the last index update in the after_ts parameter and its CCSEQ in the last_ccseq parameter. Always adding last_ccseq in your requests ensures seamless pagination without missing any index updates.\n- **Skipping Invalid Index Updates**: To maintain data accuracy, there are instances where index updates may be marked as INVALID due to exchange API errors or data processing issues. You can set the skip_invalid_messages parameter to true to omit these invalid index updates. However, this will result in gaps in CCSEQ numbers, making it harder to confirm the receipt of all index updates. For comprehensive data, we recommend not skipping invalid index updates.\n- **Efficient Data Backfilling**: While this endpoint is ideal for staying up to date with the latest index updates, it is not efficient for backfilling historical data or catching up on multiple days of missed index updates. For backfilling, use the [Index Updates Full Hour Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/index_v2_historical_messages_hour) instead. This endpoint stores index updates in hourly batches, which can contain up to 5 million index updates per hour. Using the real-time endpoint for backfilling is inefficient, as it would require downloading large volumes of data only to use a fraction of it.\n\nThis endpoint is an invaluable resource for accessing tick-level index data for specified instruments on chosen exchanges, starting from a particular timestamp. It ensures comprehensive historical analysis and up-to-date market monitoring, facilitating informed trading decisions and robust data integration.","tags":["Derivatives Indices"],"operationId":"index_v2_historical_messages","x-section":"Derivatives Indices","x-roles-required":["free","premium"],"x-cache-length-seconds":10,"x-visible-in-ai":false,"x-endpoint-group-id":"index_v1_historical_message","x-endpoint-group-name":"Index Updates","parameters":[{"name":"market","in":"query","description":"The exchange to obtain data from","required":true,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"string","enum":["binance","bit","bitget","bitmex","btcex","bullish","bybit","coinbaseinternational","crosstower","cryptodotcom","deribit","dydxv4","ftx","gateio","huobipro","hyperliquid","kraken","kucoin","mock","okex"],"x-enum-properties-info":{},"x-visibility-roles-required-enum":{},"minLength":2,"maxLength":30},"example":"binance"},{"name":"instrument","in":"query","description":"An instrument to retrieve for a specific futures indices market (you can use an example like the instrument FI_ETHUSD_231027 for futures indices on Kraken as an example).

This value is essential for establishing the starting point of your data analysis and ensuring that you capture the complete history of trading activity from the onset. **This is the only time you should not be adding the last_ccseq parameter in your request**.\n- **Handling Identical Timestamps in Pagination**: In cases where all trades returned have the same timestamp, it's crucial to refine your pagination strategy to continue data retrieval efficiently. Always include both the timestamp of the last swap in the after_ts parameter and the CCSEQ of that swap in the last_ccseq parameter when paginating. **We strongly recommend always adding last_ccseq in your requests**, as this ensures that pagination proceeds without missing any trades, capturing every transaction accurately for your analysis.\n- **Handling High Levels of Invalid Trades**: To preserve data accuracy and completeness, there are **exceptional circumstances where trades originally received may need to be marked as INVALID** due to various reasons, such as errors in exchange APIs or in our data processing. If we encounter over **50,000 invalid trades** before getting the required number of valid trades, the endpoint will stop adhering to the set limit. To effectively continue with pagination in these scenarios, evaluate the last swap recorded in the Data array and the last swap in the Invalid array. Choose the entry with the highest TIMESTAMP. If both entries share the same TIMESTAMP, prioritize the swap from the Data array.

This endpoint is particularly useful for users who need to analyze specific periods of swap activity in granular detail, helping to pinpoint market reactions to events or identify trading patterns at a precise moment in time. It is ideal for users who need to stay up to date with the latest AMM swaps.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Detailed Swap Analysis**: Traders and analysts can use this data to examine swap execution at a specific moment, useful for forensic market analysis or detailed trade reconstruction.\n- **Event-Driven Strategy Development**: Useful for developing trading strategies that capitalize on reactions to news or market events, allowing traders to study the exact moment such events impact the market.\n- **Compliance and Audit Trails**: Compliance officers can utilize this detailed data to ensure trading activities meet regulatory standards, providing a clear audit trail of transactions.\n- **Academic Research**: Researchers can leverage precise, timestamped swap data to conduct studies on market microstructures or the impact of technological changes on trading patterns.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **Financial Analysts and Market Researchers**: Professionals who need precise historical data to analyze market trends or validate market hypotheses.\n- **Regulatory and Compliance Professionals**: Individuals who require detailed transaction records for monitoring and reporting purposes.\n- **Algorithmic Traders and Quantitative Analysts**: Developers and quants developing models that depend on high-frequency swap data.\n- **Academic Institutions**: Researchers and students studying financial markets, needing access to high-resolution data for research purposes.\n\n### Data Handling Notes:\n- **Identifying the First Swap Timestamp**: To accurately determine the timestamp of the first swap for any given instrument, utilize the FIRST_AMM_SWAP_ONCHAIN_TIMESTAMP provided by the Markets + Instruments endpoint. This value is essential for establishing the starting point of your data analysis and ensuring that you capture the complete history of trading activity from the onset. **This is the only time you should not be adding the last_ccseq parameter in your request**.\n- **Handling Identical Timestamps in Pagination**: In cases where all trades returned have the same timestamp, it's crucial to refine your pagination strategy to continue data retrieval efficiently. Always include both the timestamp of the last swap in the after_ts parameter and the CCSEQ of that swap in the last_ccseq parameter when paginating. **We strongly recommend always adding last_ccseq in your requests**, as this ensures that pagination proceeds without missing any trades, capturing every transaction accurately for your analysis.\n- **Skipping Invalid Swaps**: To maintain data accuracy, there are instances where swaps may be marked as INVALID due to exchange API errors or data processing issues. You can set the skip_invalid_messages parameter to true to omit these invalid swaps. However, this will result in gaps in CCSEQ numbers, making it harder to confirm the receipt of all swaps. For comprehensive data, we recommend not skipping invalid swaps.\n- **Efficient Data Backfilling**: While this endpoint is ideal for staying up to date with the latest swaps, it is not efficient for backfilling historical data or catching up on multiple days of missed swaps. For backfilling, use the [Swaps Full Hour Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/onchain_v2_amm_historical_swap_messages_hour) instead. This endpoint stores swaps in hourly batches, which can contain up to 5 million swaps per hour. Using the real-time endpoint for backfilling is inefficient, as it would require downloading large volumes of data only to use a fraction of it.\n\nThe On-Chain AMM Swaps By Timestamp endpoint is an essential resource for anyone involved in detailed market analysis, trading strategy development, compliance, or academic research.

This endpoint meticulously captures every liquidity event executed, detailing each update's timestamp, type of liquidity event (mint, burn, collect), and associated changes in liquidity. It's particularly useful for users who need to analyze specific periods of liquidity activity in granular detail, helping to pinpoint market reactions to events or identify liquidity patterns at precise moments in time.","x-extended-description-with-markdown":"The On-Chain AMM Liquidity Updates by Timestamp endpoint provides detailed, standardized, and deduplicated liquidity update data for a specified instrument on a chosen decentralized exchange (DEX), starting from a given timestamp. This endpoint meticulously captures every liquidity event executed, detailing each update's timestamp, type of liquidity event (mint, burn, collect), and associated changes in liquidity. It's particularly useful for users who need to analyze specific periods of liquidity activity in granular detail, helping to pinpoint market reactions to events or identify liquidity patterns at precise moments in time.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Detailed Liquidity Analysis**: Traders and analysts can use this data to examine liquidity events at specific moments, useful for forensic market analysis or detailed liquidity event reconstruction.\n- **Event-Driven Strategy Development**: Ideal for developing liquidity strategies that capitalize on reactions to news or market events, allowing traders to study the exact moment such events impact liquidity.\n- **Compliance and Audit Trails**: Compliance officers can utilize this detailed data to ensure liquidity activities meet regulatory standards, providing a clear audit trail of liquidity events.\n- **Academic Research**: Researchers can leverage precise, timestamped liquidity data to conduct studies on market microstructures or the impact of technological changes on liquidity patterns.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **Financial Analysts and Market Researchers**: Professionals who need precise historical data to analyze market trends or validate market hypotheses.\n- **Regulatory and Compliance Professionals**: Entities requiring detailed transaction records for monitoring and reporting purposes.\n- **Algorithmic Traders and Quantitative Analysts**: Developers creating models that depend on high-frequency liquidity data.\n- **Academic Institutions**: Researchers and students studying financial markets and needing access to high-resolution data for empirical research.\n\n### Data Handling Notes:\n- **Identifying the First Update Timestamp**: To accurately determine the timestamp of the first update for any given instrument, utilize the FIRST_AMM_LIQUIDITY_UPDATE_ONCHAIN_TIMESTAMP provided by the Markets + Instruments endpoint. This value is essential for establishing the starting point of your data analysis and ensuring that you capture the complete history of trading activity from the onset. **This is the only time you should not be adding the last_ccseq parameter in your request**.\n- **Handling Identical Timestamps in Pagination**: In cases where all trades returned have the same timestamp, it's crucial to refine your pagination strategy to continue data retrieval efficiently. Always include both the timestamp of the last update in the after_ts parameter and the CCSEQ of that update in the last_ccseq parameter when paginating. **We strongly recommend always adding last_ccseq in your requests**, as this ensures that pagination proceeds without missing any trades, capturing every transaction accurately for your analysis.\n- **Skipping Invalid Updates**: To maintain data accuracy, there are instances where liquidity updates may be marked as INVALID due to exchange API errors or data processing issues. You can set the skip_invalid_messages parameter to true to omit these invalid updates. However, this will result in gaps in CCSEQ numbers, making it harder to confirm the receipt of all updates. For comprehensive data, we recommend not skipping invalid updates.\n- **Efficient Data Backfilling**: While this endpoint is ideal for staying up to date with the latest updates, it is not efficient for backfilling historical data or catching up on multiple days of missed updates. For backfilling, use the [Liquidity Updates Full Hour Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/onchain_v2_amm_historical_liquidity_update_messages_hour) instead. This endpoint stores updates in hourly batches, which can contain up to 5 million updates per hour. Using the real-time endpoint for backfilling is inefficient, as it would require downloading large volumes of data only to use a fraction of it.\n\nThe On-Chain AMM Liquidity Updates by Timestamp endpoint is an essential tool for anyone involved in market analysis, compliance monitoring, or liquidity management. By offering precise, timestamped data on liquidity events such as mints, burns, and collects, it supports a wide range of applications including detailed liquidity analysis, event-driven strategy development, compliance and audit trails, and academic research. Start leveraging this endpoint to gain comprehensive insights into liquidity updates and enhance your trading and liquidity strategies. Use this data to build advanced analytics tools, develop precise liquidity algorithms, and produce real-time market insights.

You can learn more about our [mapping methodology in this blog post](https://data.coindesk.com/blogs/mapping-dominance-why-it-matters-and-how-we-do-it).\n\nThe unified on-chain mapping schema handles the complexity of decentralized trading through smart contract identification, chain-specific asset resolution, and standardized base-quote pair mapping, providing integration-ready metadata for building robust DeFi data infrastructure with automatic liquidity pool discovery and ranking.\n\n### On-Chain Mapping Methodology\nThis endpoint uses a standardized format `{CONTRACT_ADDRESS}_{CHAIN_ASSET_ID}` to uniquely identify on-chain trading pools, where the contract address represents the specific liquidity pool and the chain asset ID identifies the blockchain network. The mapping resolves complex token relationships through base-quote pair normalization, handling wrapped tokens, stablecoins, and protocol-specific implementations with appropriate mathematical transforms.\nWhen querying by trading pair (e.g., `WETH-USDC`), the system identifies all matching pools across protocols and returns the most active pool by volume or liquidity metrics, along with warnings about multiple pool matches. Transform functions handle decimal precision differences, price inversion requirements, and mathematical adjustments needed for accurate cross-protocol price normalization.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **DeFi Integration Platforms**: Build normalized on-chain data feeds with consistent pool identification across all major DEXs, AMMs, and liquidity protocols, handling complex token mappings and mathematical transforms.\n- **Cross-Protocol Arbitrage**: Enable systematic price comparison and arbitrage detection across decentralized venues using canonical pool mapping and real-time liquidity depth analysis.\n- **Liquidity Analytics**: Track pool performance, volume trends, and liquidity migration patterns using standardized pool identification and historical depth tracking across protocols.\n- **Portfolio Management**: Implement DeFi position tracking with accurate LP token valuation, impermanent loss calculation, and yield farming analytics using correct pool references.\n- **MEV and Trading Bots**: Deploy systematic trading strategies across DEXs using unified pool discovery, optimal routing calculation, and cross-protocol slippage analysis.\n- **Risk Management Systems**: Monitor on-chain exposure and counterparty risk through standardized pool mapping, protocol identification, and liquidity concentration metrics.\n- **Market Making Operations**: Implement automated liquidity provision across multiple AMMs using unified pool interfaces, inventory management, and cross-protocol yield optimization.\n- **Research and Analytics**: Access clean DeFi data for protocol analysis, tokenomics research, and decentralized market microstructure studies with consistent pool categorization.\n\n### Target Audience\n- **DeFi Protocol Developers**: Teams building cross-protocol applications, aggregators, and yield optimization platforms requiring standardized pool identification and routing logic.\n- **Quantitative Researchers**: Analysts studying DeFi market dynamics, AMM mechanics, and cross-protocol arbitrage opportunities using normalized on-chain data.\n- **Institutional DeFi Teams**: Asset managers incorporating decentralized trading with systematic pool discovery, liquidity analysis, and cross-protocol position management.\n- **MEV Searchers and Arbitrageurs**: Traders requiring real-time pool mapping, optimal routing calculation, and cross-DEX opportunity identification for automated strategies.\n- **Market Data Vendors**: Data providers needing canonical DeFi reference data for client feeds, TVL calculation, and normalized decentralized market products.\n- **Risk Management Teams**: Portfolio managers tracking DeFi exposure, protocol risks, and liquidity concentration using standardized pool identification and analytics.\n- **Trading Infrastructure Engineers**: Backend developers building DeFi trading systems with deterministic pool discovery, routing optimization, and cross-protocol integration.\n- **Compliance & Operations**: Teams managing DeFi trading operations, protocol due diligence, and cross-venue position reconciliation for decentralized derivatives.","tags":["On-Chain DEX"],"operationId":"onchain_v1_amm_markets_instruments","x-section":"On-Chain DEX","x-roles-required":[],"x-cache-length-seconds":60,"x-visible-in-ai":false,"x-endpoint-group-id":"onchain_v1_amm_markets_instrument","x-endpoint-group-name":"Markets + Instruments","parameters":[{"name":"market","in":"query","description":"The exchange to obtain data from","required":false,"explode":false,"style":"form","deprecated":false,"schema":{"type":"string","default":"","enum":["aerodromeslipstream","aerodromev1","balancerv2","curve","pancakeswapv2","pancakeswapv3","sushiswapv2","sushiswapv3","uniswapv1","uniswapv2","uniswapv3",""],"x-enum-properties-info":{},"x-visibility-roles-required-enum":{},"minLength":0,"maxLength":30},"example":"uniswapv2"},{"name":"instruments","in":"query","description":"A comma separated array of pool smart contract address and chain asset id (0x88e6a0c2ddd26feeb64f039a2c41296fcb3f5640_2), base id to quote id (306-14), and/or base symbol to quote symbol (WETH-USDC).

This endpoint streamlines access to Ethereum address data by consolidating multiple data points into one efficient response, facilitating development, analysis, and research. BETA WARNING - We know the dataset may miss some contracts and events, as traces are needed to fully capture deployments and interactions.\n\n### (BETA) Data Handling Notes\nWe are aware of some limitations in identifying certain contracts and events. Initially, the dataset was built using transaction logs, but we realized that traces are necessary to fully capture and identify all contract deployments and interactions. This means that contracts deployed by other contracts may not be accounted for, and the metadata might miss key information such as:\n- **Internal Transactions**: Without traces, internal transactions (value transfers or interactions that occur within smart contracts) are not visible, which may result in incomplete activity data for contracts.\n- **Contract Creation by Other Contracts**: Contracts that are deployed by other contracts will not be fully identifiable, affecting the completeness of contract metadata.\n- **Event Emission**: Some events triggered within smart contracts may not be captured without traces, leading to incomplete insights into contract activities or token transfers.\n- **Failed Contract Interactions**: Failed transactions that do not emit logs, such as out-of-gas errors, may be missed without looking at traces, which could skew address activity data.\n\nWe have all the trace data and are actively regenerating the dataset in the background, but while the reprocessing is quick, we're continuously identifying and addressing new edge cases.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Address Verification**: Quickly determine if an address is a smart contract or a wallet.\n- **Transaction Analysis**: Retrieve the first and last transaction details to study address activity over time.\n- **Token Information Retrieval**: Access essential token metadata for ERC-20 contracts, including name, symbol, decimals, and total supply.\n- **Supply Monitoring**: Analyze supply metrics to understand token distribution, including circulating, locked, and burnt supplies.\n- **DeFi Application Development**: Incorporate address and token metadata into decentralized finance platforms and services.\n- **Blockchain Research and Analytics**: Perform in-depth analyses of address behaviors and characteristics for research purposes.\n\n### Target Audiences\n- **Blockchain Developers**: Integrate comprehensive address data into applications without the need for multiple API calls.\n- **Cryptocurrency Analysts**: Gain insights into address activities and token metrics for market analysis.\n- **Data Scientists and Researchers**: Access detailed blockchain data for modeling and analytical projects.\n- **Auditors and Compliance Professionals**: Obtain accurate address information for auditing and regulatory compliance.\n- **DeFi Platform Builders**: Leverage address metadata to enhance decentralized finance services and user experiences.\n\nBy utilizing the On-Chain ETH Address Metadata endpoint, users can efficiently access vital Ethereum address information, eliminating the complexity of gathering disparate data and enabling a more streamlined workflow.

These tokens are required to pay transaction fees, secure the network through staking or mining, and may also confer on‑chain voting rights. Examples: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), BNB Chain (BNB), Cronos (CRO)."},"STABLECOIN":{"name":"Stablecoin","description":"Digital assets designed to maintain a stable value by pegging exclusively to fiat currencies (such as the U.S. dollar or euro), typically through full or partial reserve backing, algorithmic stabilization mechanisms, or collateralized baskets of assets designed to track a specific fiat value. Their core function is to provide price stability for use as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value within the crypto ecosystem. This category excludes tokens pegged to commodities (e.g., gold), which are classified under wrapped collateral. Examples: Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Reserve (RSV)."},"CROSS_CHAIN_INFRASTRUCTURE":{"name":"Cross-Chain Infrastructure","description":"Digital assets and protocols whose primary function is to enable interoperability between otherwise independent blockchains. This category includes Layer‑0 networks with shared security, trust‑minimized bridges, cross‑chain messaging systems, asset‑transfer hubs, and multi‑chain development frameworks or middleware that facilitate seamless cross‑chain operation. Examples: Polkadot (DOT), Cosmos (ATOM), Axelar (AXL), LayerZero (L0), Wormhole (WORM), THORChain (RUNE)."},"DECENTRALIZED_INFRASTRUCTURE":{"name":"Decentralized Infrastructure","description":"Digital assets that supply foundational infrastructure services, both digital and physical, for decentralized applications and networks. This includes decentralized storage networks, compute/GPU marketplaces, wireless networks, energy grids, sensor networks, data‑availability layers, and blockchain‑agnostic naming services. These projects tokenize infrastructure resources that can be contributed by distributed providers and consumed by users within the network. Examples: Chainlink (LINK), Filecoin (FIL), Arweave (AR), Akash Network (AKT), Render (RNDR), Helium (HNT), Energy Web Token (EWT), Celestia (TIA), and Ethereum Name Service (ENS)."},"IDENTITY":{"name":"Identity","description":"Digital assets whose primary purpose is to issue, verify, or manage user credentials, or KYC attestations—enabling individuals or organizations to prove attributes such as uniqueness, age, or compliance to other parties. The industry covers credential‑issuing platforms and identity wallets. Examples: Civic (CVC), Worldcoin (WLD), BrightID (BrightID), Proof of Humanity (POH)."},"MEMBERSHIP":{"name":"Membership","description":"Digital assets that provide access, participation rights, or privileges within a specific community, network, or organization. These tokens often serve as a gateway to join or interact with decentralized platforms—especially Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)—by enabling features like proposal submission, task participation, or gated content access. While they may include governance functionality, their primary purpose is membership and access, not decision-making. Examples: Aragon (ANT), DAOstack (GEN), Friends With Benefits (FWB)."},"COLLECTIBLE":{"name":"Collectible (NFT)","description":"Digital assets implemented as, or powering, non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This industry covers both the NFTs themselves—including unique or limited-edition items such as artwork, avatars, in-game assets, memorabilia, tickets, or tokenized domain names—and the fungible tokens or blockchains specifically designed for their creation, trading, or utility. Examples: ApeCoin (APE), Flow (FLOW), Rarible (RARI), Immutable (IMX), Blur (BLUR), LooksRare (LOOKS)."},"REPUTATION":{"name":"Reputation","description":"Digital assets whose primary function is to record or compute reputation scores and trust metrics for blockchain addresses or users, based on on‑chain behavior or verifiable off‑chain activity. These scores are typically consumed by other protocols for purposes such as governance weighting, credit scoring, or access control. This tag includes reputation-scoring tokens and dedicated reputation networks, but excludes projects focused solely on issuing personal credentials. Examples: Augur (REP), KARMA Protocol (KARMA), Gitcoin Passport (GTC Passport)."},"GOVERNANCE":{"name":"Governance","description":"Digital assets that grant holders the right to vote on proposals, influence protocol parameters, or shape the future direction of a decentralized project. These tokens are used primarily to decentralize control and decision-making, without necessarily conferring broader access or membership privileges in the network. Examples: Uniswap (UNI), Maker (MKR), and Tezos (XTZ)."},"WRAPPED_COLLATERAL":{"name":"Wrapped Collateral","description":"Tokens that represent underlying crypto or real-world assets in a wrapped form, enabling their seamless integration into decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. These assets are typically fully collateralized 1:1 and maintain a verifiable claim to the original asset, whether it's another cryptocurrency or a commodity (such as gold). Wrapped collateral tokens are used to bring non-native assets into new ecosystems for purposes such as lending, liquidity provision, yield strategies, and synthetic asset creation. This category excludes fiat-pegged stablecoins, which are classified separately. Examples: Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Ren Bitcoin (RenBTC), PAX Gold (PAXG), Tether Gold (XAUT)."},"DECENTRALIZED_FINANCE_PROTOCOL":{"name":"DeFi","description":"Digital assets associated with decentralized financial protocols that enable financial services without reliance on centralized intermediaries. This includes protocols for decentralized trading, lending and borrowing, stablecoin issuance, synthetic assets, yield generation, and other peer-to-peer financial activities. While many leverage smart contracts, the defining feature is their role in facilitating decentralized finance. Examples: Uniswap (UNI), Curve (CRV), Aave (AAVE), Compound (COMP), and Maker (MKR)."},"EXCHANGE_UTILITY":{"name":"Exchange Utility","description":"Digital assets issued by centralized cryptocurrency exchanges that create economic alignment between the exchange's business success and token holders. These tokens typically provide holders with tangible benefits including trading fee discounts, priority access to new features or token sales, participation in exchange revenue or profits, governance input on certain platform decisions, and periodic token burns linked to exchange performance. Unlike general platform tokens, exchange utility tokens are directly tied to the economics of specific trading venues and derive value primarily from the exchange's market position and user base. Examples: Binance Coin (BNB), UNUS SED LEO (LEO), FTX Token (FTT), KuCoin Token (KCS), and OKB (OKB)."},"MEME":{"name":"Meme","description":"Digital assets created primarily as internet culture phenomena, derived from memes, pop culture references, or social media trends, with minimal technical innovation or utility beyond community sentiment and branding. These tokens typically gain value through viral adoption, social signaling, and speculative trading rather than underlying technological utility or revenue-generating mechanisms. While originally created for entertainment or satirical purposes, some have evolved into significant market participants with dedicated ecosystems. This category includes both stand-alone meme tokens and specialized blockchains explicitly designed around meme culture. Examples: Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Floki Inu (FLOKI)."},"YIELD_FARMING":{"name":"Yield Optimization","description":"Digital assets associated with protocols that automate and optimize yield-generating strategies across DeFi ecosystems. These projects focus specifically on maximizing returns from lending, liquidity provision, and staking through automated capital allocation, compounding, and strategy switching. Yield optimization protocols typically employ smart contract \"vaults\" that aggregate user funds, implement complex yield strategies, and automatically reinvest earnings to maximize APY. Unlike general DeFi protocols, these platforms are purpose-built for yield enhancement rather than providing base financial primitives. Examples: Yearn Finance (YFI), Convex Finance (CVX), Beefy Finance (BIFI), Harvest Finance (FARM), and Pickle Finance (PICKLE)."},"LIQUID_STAKED":{"name":"Liquid Staked Tokens","description":"Digital assets that function exclusively as receipt tokens for staked assets in proof-of-stake networks. Each token represents a 1:1 claim on the underlying staked asset plus accrued staking rewards, with the distinguishing feature that these tokens can be transferred, traded, or used in DeFi while the original assets remain locked in staking. This category is strictly limited to the derivative receipt tokens themselves (not the protocols that issue them). Examples: Lido's stETH (staked ETH), Rocket Pool's rETH (rETH), Binance's BETH (Binance ETH), and Marinade's mSOL (mSOL)."},"GAMING":{"name":"Gaming","description":"Digital assets and blockchain networks that power blockchain‑based games, supporting in‑game economies, asset ownership, and play‑to‑earn models; includes both game‑native tokens and gaming‑focused blockchain networks. Examples: Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND), Enjin Coin (ENJ), ImmutableX (IMX), and Gala (GALA)."},"ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE":{"name":"AI (Artificial Intelligence)","description":"Digital assets and blockchain projects that integrate artificial intelligence technologies to enhance data processing, decision-making, and automation within decentralized ecosystems. These assets may focus on AI-driven analytics, machine learning models, or AI-based applications that leverage blockchain for transparency and security. Examples: SingularityNET (AGIX), Fetch.ai (FET)."},"METAVERSE":{"name":"Metaverse","description":"Digital assets and blockchain projects that create immersive virtual environments, enabling users to interact, socialize, and transact within a digital universe. These assets often support virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and 3D spaces, facilitating the creation and exchange of digital goods and experiences. Examples: Decentraland (MANA), The Sandbox (SAND), Somnium Space (CUBE)."},"ORACLE":{"name":"Oracle Networks","description":"Digital assets powering specialized networks that serve as the bridge between blockchains and external data sources, providing verifiable real-world information to smart contracts. Oracle networks focus on secure data delivery, price feeds, and off-chain computation services that enable critical DeFi and smart contract functionality. These tokens typically incentivize a decentralized network of node operators to retrieve, verify, and deliver accurate data on-chain, with economic security mechanisms to ensure reliable operation. Examples: Chainlink (LINK), Band Protocol (BAND), API3 (API3), Pyth Network (PYTH), and UMA (UMA)."},"REAL_WORLD_ASSETS":{"name":"Real World Assets","description":"Digital tokens that represent ownership or claims on physical or traditional financial assets outside the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These include tokenized securities, real estate, carbon credits, bonds, invoices, and other traditional assets brought on-chain through tokenization protocols. Unlike wrapped collateral which primarily represents other digital assets or commodities, RWAs connect blockchain technology directly to traditional finance and physical assets through legal and regulatory frameworks. Examples: Centrifuge (CFG), Maker (MKR) Real World Asset vaults, Ondo Finance tokens, RealT tokens, Polymesh (POLYX), and tokenized treasury bills."},"PRIVACY":{"name":"Privacy","description":"Digital assets whose primary purpose is to provide transaction-level confidentiality at the base protocol or through privacy-preserving smart-contract execution. These networks hide information such as sender and receiver identities, transferred amounts, or on-chain payloads using techniques like ring signatures, stealth addresses, confidential transactions, zero-knowledge proofs, or MimbleWimble. This industry covers native coins of privacy-focused Layer-1 blockchains and privacy-preserving compute platforms where confidentiality is a core feature rather than an incidental add-on. It excludes governance tokens for mixers or privacy dApps built on other chains, general networking privacy tools such as mixnets or VPNs, and general-purpose platforms where privacy is optional and not the main value proposition. Examples: Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), Firo (FIRO)."}}},"example":""}],"deprecated":false,"responses":{"200":{"description":"Success response from the API.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ASSET_TOPLIST_RESPONSE"}}}},"400":{"description":"The 400 error occurs when some of the data sent is malformed.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ERROR"}}}},"401":{"description":"The 401 error occurs when you don't use a valid API Key on an endpoint that requires authentication.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ERROR"}}}},"403":{"description":"The 403 error occurs when you don't use a valid API Key on an endpoint that requires authentication.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ERROR"}}}},"404":{"description":"The 404 error can either be returned when some/all of parameters sent are not found within our system.

The block header comprises a nonce that miners frequently modify to obtain different hash values. Hence, the consensus necessitates the earned value to remain within a particular bound. To maintain an agreement across the network concerning the propagation of new blocks, PoW imposes a complicated puzzle that needs to be resolved by cooperating nodes. Miners that overcome the puzzle will be granted access to append a new block. The puzzle preserves an adjusted difficulty and is confronted by estimating the nonce’s value. This value is incorporated with the block’s header information to feed the SHA-256 hash function. The hash function will then convert all inputs to generate the hash value. If the output of the hash function holds a value beneath an appointed threshold, the estimated nonce will be accepted, and the miner is allowed to append a block into the blockchain. Hence, whenever the objective value is acquired by a miner, it will accordingly broadcast the block throughout the network, and every single node within the entire network will be asked to confirm the authenticity of the hash value and append the corresponding block to their blockchain"},"POS":{"name":"Proof of Stake","description":"Proof of stake (PoS), which was initially proposed for Peercoin, has been used as an alternative to PoW to eliminate the excessive power consumption of nodes. Since the election of the block proposer based on the account balance seems unfair, many proposed solutions incorporate the stake size. Although PoS is energy efficient in comparison with PoW, it is not resilient to attacks. Accordingly, several blockchain solutions initially employ PoW and gradually transform to PoS"},"POB":{"name":"Proof of Burn","description":"Proof of burn has been proposed as an energy-efficient, sustainable alternative to PoW where miners use an irretrievable address to convey coins and burn them. The irretrievable address is referred to as an eater address and incorporates a public key that is not correlated with any private key to prevent coin retrieval. Once a coin is sent to the eater address, it is permanently eliminated from the network. In PoB, the miners do not invest in physical currency as the cryptocurrencies are burned intentionally to denote the investment in blockchain. Burning cryptocurrency generates virtual mining power; hence, the more coins a user burns in favour of the system, the more mining power it acquires. In addition, the miner, as mentioned above, is more likely to be appointed as the validator of the block. The notion behind PoB is similar to PoW as getting the title of mining a block in PoB bears a resemblance to purchasing computing resources in PoW. All transactions that indicate transferring coins to eater addresses are recorded, and SHA-256 is employed for the calculation of the burn hash concerning each transaction in the network. Eventually, the miner who holds the least assess of the burn hash attains the mining right"},"POC":{"name":"Proof of Capacity","description":"Proof of Capacity (also known as Proof of Space or Proof of Storage) is a consensus algorithm that is cheaper than PoW in terms of required computing infrastructure, as it requires the use of hard disks or cloud storage systems. It operates based on large stored data sets, known as parcels. Their multiplicity enhances the probability of mining a new block for the corresponding node. The proof of space is executed in two stages. The first stage is plotting, where the hard disk capacity that the miner has devoted is evaluated by incorporating Shabal hash function and plotting the hard disk. The hash function is then seeded using the miner’s ID and nonce. Mining is performed during the second stage. It refers to the most recent block on the chain to calculate the generation hash. The total number of scoops is then calculated by incorporating the hash module to generate the target value that also uses the outputs of the plotting stage. Afterwards, the network re-calculates the scoop for each hash to validate the deadlines for each miner. The miner that correlates the shortest published deadline generates the next block and receives a reward for the transaction. The advantage of PoSpace is its energy efficiency, as it does not impose high requirements on hardware. However, it is known to be susceptible to malware attacks, since its hashes are stored on a hard disk. This enhances the vulnerability of the data and risks of being tampered with. Spacecoin, Chia, and Burstcoin are a few of the many approaches that have incorporated PoSpace."},"POA":{"name":"Proof of Authority","description":"Proof of Authority has been proposed as an underlying consensus algorithm for permissioned blockchains. This algorithm substitutes a lighter message transmission scheme in comparison with the BFT algorithm, which has led to the superiority of this approach concerning its performance. There are two implementations of the PoA algorithm known as Aura and Clique, which was primitively implemented on Ethereum for private networks. Both Aura and Clique exploit a similar block proposal scheme in which the trusted authority such as the current mining leader proposes a new block. Afterwards, Aura performs the block acceptance procedure, which is not required in Clique implementation. PoA is executed in several time divisions and during each interval; the authorities alternate using round-robin to propose blocks. Each proposed block is accepted once its signed off by the majority of authorized entities. Moreover, the procedure of discerning authorities results in the centralised configuration of PoA, which makes this approach appropriate for private consortiums"},"POET":{"name":"Proof of Elapsed Time","description":"Proof of elapsed time is an underlying consensus mechanism which has been initially proposed by Intel to improve energy efficiency and eliminate the waste of resources. PoET is highly dependent on dedicated hardware to restrict cooperation and decentralization. PoET reaches consensus by the random election of block leaders where the winning odds are spread out evenly throughout the network, and each node holds the same chance of becoming the winner"},"POH":{"name":"Proof of History","description":"Proof of history has been introduced to tackle issues associated with intensive computation. This approach executes the SHA-256 hashing algorithm in a consecutive manner to exploit the output of each round as the corresponding input to the subsequent round. Leaders are in charge of confirmation and integration of each transaction with the prevalent hash. PoH is known to be energy efficient as it does not perform intensive mining procedures in comparison with traditional PoW. However, it leans towards wealthier leaders which results in a more centralized and deterministic process and requires more capacity due to consecutive execution of the hashing function"},"POE":{"name":"Proof of Existence","description":"Proof of existence as an online service exploits a decentralized certification SHA256. PoE permanently validates the existence of data by storing its cryptographic digest and the corresponding submission date using blockchain. This service can publicly prove the ownership of data without revealing the data itself. It also eliminates the requirements for trusting any central authority. This approach provides anonymity, privacy, and decentralized proof that does not rely on a single centralized entity. The application of PoE ranges from ensuring the integrity of documents, document time stamping, and denoting the ownership of data without disclosing the content. PoE, as a blockchain notary service, provides instant and secure validation of the existence of any document, agreement, or contract. Moreover, it implies rules to allow updates in the documents and keep track of the updates."},"PAXOS":{"name":"PAXOS","description":"As the very first proposed consensus algorithm, paxos facilitates the selection of a single value beneath the crash or faulty circumstances of the network. Paxos classifies the nodes into proposers, acceptors, and learners. Proposers provide a message indicating a proposal number and forward it to the acceptor. The proposal number is considered as a timeline throughout the process, in which the proposal with a higher number is the most recent update. The acceptor compares the acquired proposal number with the current known value, and only accepts the proposal if it is more recent. Afterward, the acceptor forwards a response message indicating whether the proposal has been accepted or rejected, corresponding proposal number, and all accepted values. The proposer is required to investigate whether the majority of acceptors have rejected the proposal or not. In case of rejection, the proposer updates the proposal number with the most recent value. Otherwise, the acceptor broadcasts the accepted value to all learners on the network. To reach consensus in paxos, the proposer should receive at least N/2 − 1 acceptances (N is the number of proposals) from the acceptors"},"RCM":{"name":"Ripple Consensus Mechanism","description":"XRP uses the Ripple Consensus Mechanism (RCM), which is a consensus algorithm based on server validation. The RCM is a distributed agreement protocol that is designed to ensure the integrity of the XRP Ledger and the transactions it contains. The RCM is an iterative consensus process that allows for asynchronous agreement among a set of validating servers. It uses a voting system to reach consensus on the order and content of transactions in the XRP Ledger. Each server votes on a transaction set, and if a supermajority of servers agree, the transaction set is accepted and added to the ledger."},"OTHER_BFT":{"name":"Other Byzantine Fault Tolerance","description":"Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is the property of a system that is able to resist the class of failures derived from the Byzantine Generals’ Problem. This means that a BFT system is able to continue operating even if some of the nodes fail or act maliciously."},"THE_TANGLE":{"name":"The Tangle","description":"The Tangle is a distributed ledger technology based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure which is used by IOTA to reach consensus. This allows for faster and more efficient transactions than traditional blockchain systems, as well as scalability. The Tangle is unique because it does not use miners or staking to reach consensus. Instead, it uses user validation to reach consensus and each transaction must approve two other transactions before it is confirmed. This makes the Tangle more secure and energy efficient than traditional blockchain systems."},"POUW":{"name":"Proof of Useful Work","description":"Proof-of-useful-work (PoUW) is a blockchain consensus protocol that uses dedicated hardware called \"node machines\" that are of the same standardized specification. The Network Nervous System (NNS) selects nodes by looking at the node provider, the data center the node is installed within, and its geography and jurisdiction. The hardware is used as the stake, creating a secure network of dedicated hardware that produces blocks through useful smart contract computations, allowing node providers to earn rewards."},"POST":{"name":"Proof of Storage","description":"Proof-of-Storage is the mechanism underpinning the Filecoin blockchain, which allows participants to prove their contribution of storage capacity to the network. This proof-of-storage construction is distinct from other blockchains that require computing power. It allows participants to guarantee (to a high tolerance) that they are contributing a given amount of storage, and also allows for efficient verification of a participant's storage of a particular piece of data, without requiring that one have a copy of the file itself. This proof takes the form of a probabilistic argument, rather than a concrete proof, as it is highly unlikely to be able to convince other participants that one is making a contribution one is not."},"SCP":{"name":"Stellar Consensus Protocol","description":"Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) is a consensus mechanism used by the Stellar network to reach agreement on transactions. Unlike Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, SCP relies on the agreement of trusted nodes to update the ledger. Each participating Stellar Core node decides what set of other nodes they want to trust, called a quorum set. A quorum is a set of nodes sufficient to reach an agreement. SCP prioritizes fault tolerance and safety over liveness, and uses federated voting to achieve agreement on transaction sets. SCP has three steps of federated voting: Vote, Accept, and Confirm. In the nomination protocol, candidate transaction sets are selected to be included in a ledger, and in the ballot protocol, the network ensures that the agreed-upon transaction set is included in the next ledger.

The response format offers rich data, including asset type, ID, symbol, URI, public availability, name, logo URL, and various other attributes that facilitate a thorough understanding of each asset's characteristics and market standing.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Retrieve assets using symbols, names, or IDs with support for both textual and numerical queries.\n- **Intelligent Prioritization and Sorting**: Implements sophisticated ranking logic that prioritizes exact matches and considers market capitalization to deliver the most relevant results.\n- **Default Top Assets Retrieval**: When no search string is provided, the endpoint returns top assets by market capitalization, aiding in market insights without specific queries.\n- **Comprehensive Asset Data**: Access detailed information for each asset, including type, symbol, name, logo URL, market cap, and attributes like HAS_SMART_CONTRACT_CAPABILITIES and ROOT_ASSET_TYPE.\n- **Optimized User Experience**: Enhances asset discovery by efficiently sorting and presenting assets based on relevancy and market significance.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Integration into Financial Platforms**: Enhance financial websites and applications with robust asset search functionality to improve user engagement.\n- **Market Research and Analysis**: Empower analysts and researchers to retrieve precise asset data for in-depth market studies and reporting.\n- **Investment and Trading Tools**: Assist investors and traders in quickly finding and evaluating assets to make informed decisions.\n- **Educational Resources**: Provide educational platforms with advanced search capabilities to facilitate learning and research in the cryptocurrency space.\n- **Customizable Search Widgets**: Develop widgets for websites that require live asset data and search functionalities to enhance user interaction.\n\n### Target Audiences\n- **Developers and Integrators**: Implement advanced search features into applications, enhancing functionality and user experience.\n- **Financial Institutions and Exchanges**: Improve asset discovery on trading platforms, aiding users in finding and trading cryptocurrencies efficiently.\n- **Investors and Traders**: Access precise and relevant asset information quickly to inform trading strategies and investment decisions.\n- **Educational Institutions and Media Platforms**: Offer readers and learners precise search tools to access detailed cryptocurrency asset information.\n- **Market Analysts and Researchers**: Utilize intelligent search functionality to access prioritized asset data for comprehensive market analysis.\n\nBy leveraging the Asset Search endpoint, users can optimize asset discovery and enhance their platforms with intelligent search functionality, catering to a wide range of applications in the dynamic digital asset ecosystem.\n\n**Notes on 'Intelligent Prioritization and Sorting' Logic:**\n- **Empty search_string**: When no search_string is provided, the endpoint defaults to delivering the top assets by market capitalization, up to the specified limit. This functionality ensures that users can still discover valuable assets and gain insights into the market's leading entities, even in the absence of a specific query.\n- **Exact Asset ID Match**: Results with a search_string exactly matching an asset's ID (interpreted as an integer) are given the highest priority.\n- **Exact Symbol Match**: The second ranking criteria is based on exact symbol match but with a caviat. When a user inputs a search_string such as \"ET\" or \"BIT,\" the search functionality employs a sophisticated logic to prioritize results, focusing on exact symbol matches. If the search_string is textual and the first asset in the search results precisely matches the search_string, the algorithm assesses the market capitalizations of the top two assets. If the second asset—whether it's Bitcoin in the case of \"BIT\" or \"ETH\" when the search is \"ET\"—has a higher market capitalization than both a predefined threshold and the first asset's market cap, their positions are swapped. This approach ensures that for searches like \"ET\" and \"BIT,\" the system prioritizes assets like \"ETH\" and Bitcoin, not solely based on exact textual matches but also considering their market prominence. Consequently, if a user searches for \"BIT\" and finds a lesser-known asset with the symbol \"BIT\" and Bitcoin, or searches for \"ET\" and finds \"ET\" and \"ETH,\" the system will elevate Bitcoin or \"ETH\" in the results, reflecting their significant market relevance and aligning with probable user intent in a unified, efficient operation.\n- **Symbol Match with High Market Cap**: Symbols starting with the search_string and having a circulating market cap over 10 million USD are ranked third.\n- **Name Match with High Market Cap**: Names containing the search_string and with a circulating market cap over 10 million USD are ranked fourth.\n- **Partial Symbol Match**: Assets with symbols partially matching the search_string (starting with it) are ranked fifth.\n- **Combined Symbol and Name Partial Match**: Assets with symbols partially matching the search_string anywhere and names starting with the search_string are ranked sixth.\n- **Broad Match for Symbol and Name**: Assets with symbols or names that broadly match the search_string anywhere are ranked seventh.\n- **All Other Matches**: Assets not fitting the above criteria are ranked last.\n\nFollowing this prioritization, assets are further ordered by their circulating market capitalization in descending order. This ensures that, within each priority level, assets of higher economic value are presented first, aiding in a more nuanced and efficient asset discovery process. This logic is designed to optimize the search experience, allowing users to find relevant assets quickly based on ID, symbol, name, and market significance.","tags":["Asset"],"operationId":"asset_v1_search","x-section":"Asset","x-roles-required":[],"x-cache-length-seconds":5,"x-visible-in-ai":true,"x-endpoint-group-id":"asset_v1_search_group","x-endpoint-group-name":"Search","parameters":[{"name":"search_string","in":"query","description":"The search_string parameter enables users to search assets by symbols, names, or IDs, offering flexibility in query handling.

This enhancement allows more flexibility in identifying assets within your requests.\n- **Adjust the `groups` Parameter**: Ensure your integration aligns with the updated `groups` parameter, which now has revised allowed values and transformations. This update helps manage and structure response data more effectively by removing duplicates and handling empty values better.\n- **Incorporate the `quote_asset` Parameter**: Add the `quote_asset` parameter to specify the desired currency for conversions. The default remains USD, but specifying this parameter enables direct conversions in the API response.\n- **Optional `asset_lookup_priority` Parameter**: Use the `asset_lookup_priority` parameter to control the resolution of asset identifiers when multiple are provided.

This change enhances readability and direct access to asset data. For example for the paramater `assets=BTC`, the reponse used to be `{ \"Data\": { \"ID\": 1, \"SYMBOL\": \"BTC\", ....}, Err:{}}` now it is `{ \"Data\": { \"BTC\":{ \"ID\": 1, \"SYMBOL\": \"BTC\", ....}}, Err:{}}`.\n\n### Summary of Benefits\n- **Enhanced Flexibility**: The `assets` parameter’s ability to accept IDs, symbols, or URIs simplifies integration and reduces potential errors.\n- **Direct Currency Conversion**: The `quote_asset` parameter and new `_CONVERSION` fields eliminate the need for client-side conversion logic.\n- **Clearer Data Structure**: The nested response format organizes data under the queried asset, improving data handling and parsing.\n- **Comprehensive Field Additions**: New fields like `PRICE_CONVERSION_RATE` and `PRICE_CONVERSION_SOURCE` provide detailed conversion insights for more transparent and informed data handling.\n\nMigrating to `/asset/v2/metadata` will provide a more robust and feature-rich integration, enabling better asset identification, flexible currency conversions, and improved response data structure for seamless application use.","tags":["Deprecated"],"operationId":"asset_v1_data_by_symbol","x-section":"Deprecated","x-roles-required":["free","free"],"x-cache-length-seconds":300,"x-visible-in-ai":false,"x-endpoint-group-id":"asset_v1_data","x-endpoint-group-name":"Metadata","parameters":[{"name":"asset_symbol","in":"query","description":"The unique symbol of the cryptocurrency asset for which you wish to retrieve information.

As our first and most critical user, we ensure that our tools and systems meet the high standards we set for ourselves. This **\"eat your own dog food\"** philosophy not only **showcases our belief in our products** but also ensures that when you use them, they have already passed the stringent tests of continuous internal use.\n\n## Essential Guidelines and Considerations for API Usage\n\n- **Data Update Frequency**: Data on all the endpoints is continuously updated; however, users should be mindful of potential delays depending on the data source (centralized exchange APIs, on-chain data, news, etc) and data complexity. Real-time data may have slight latency (under 100ms) depending on network conditions.\n- **Rate Limiting**: To maintain optimal performance and service availability, users must adhere to the rate limiting guidelines provided further down in this document. Exceeding these limits may result in temporary access restrictions.\n- **Compliance with Legal Regulations**: Users are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations pertaining to the use and dissemination of blockchain and digital asset data in their respective jurisdictions.\n- **Data Interpretation**: Our endpoints offer an unparalleled depth of understanding; however, users should be well-versed in blockchain and financial markets concepts to accurately interpret and utilize the data provided.\n- **Third-Party Data Sources**: While we strive for accuracy and authenticity by complementing our data with trusted third-party sources, users should be aware that we cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of data derived from external providers.\n- **Potential Costs and Licensing**: Depending on the subscription level and usage, additional costs may apply. Be aware of any applicable licensing terms and agreements.\n- **Robust Data Integration**: Ensure that the data integration with your application is robust, taking advantage of our standardized instrument mapping and unified formats. Your integration will remain resilient as our Versioning and Deprecation Policy guarantees that changes to data structures or parameters occur only in new versions of endpoints, allowing for stable integration with existing versions.\n- **Privacy Considerations**: Be mindful of privacy regulations and best practices when utilizing personal or sensitive data in conjunction with our API, aligning your use with relevant legal and ethical standards.\n- **Availability and Redundancy**: Understand that while we strive to provide maximum uptime, unexpected outages may occur. Implement fallback mechanisms to handle such scenarios.\n- **Versioning and Deprecation Policy**: CoinDesk may introduce new versions of endpoints, deprecating old ones. Deprecated endpoints will continue to function with no changes to data structures or parameters, and their documentation will be moved to the Deprecated Section of the product list.\n\n## Authentication and Security\n\nEnsuring the secure and efficient interaction with the CoinDesk Digital Asset API is paramount to us. We've designed our authentication methods to provide speed, ease of use and safety in every interaction.\n\nWhen accessing the CoinDesk API, there are several methods to authenticate your requests, each with its own benefits, allowing flexibility depending on your integration needs:\n\n- **Query Parameter**: You can append your API key directly to the URL of your request as follows: `https://data-api.coindesk.com/index/cc/v1/latest/tick?market=ccix&instruments=BTC-USD&api_key={YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}`. This method is straightforward and easy to test, as you can simply paste the URL into a browser or a tool like cURL to make a request.\n- **Authorization Header**: Alternatively, you can send your API key in the header of your HTTP request. **As a Bearer Token**: `Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}` or as a Custom API Key Header: `Authorization: Apikey {YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}`. Using headers is a common practice that keeps the API key from being displayed in the URL, which could be a security enhancement.\n- **X-API-Key Header**: Lastly, you have the option to use a dedicated header: `x-api-key: {YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}`. This is a simple and clean way to include your API key and is especially useful when you have to set up multiple headers and want to keep them clearly organized.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your application's architecture and security protocols. Each method is designed to provide secure, effective authentication with minimal hassle.\n\n**Easy Authentication** with **Uncompromising Security**:\n\n- **Protecting Your API Key**: Keep your API key private and avoid placing it in publicly accessible locations such as client-side code (e.g., JavaScript within a web page), public repositories on platforms like GitHub, or shared documents on cloud services. Storing the API key in a secure server environment or using environment variables is recommended to maintain confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access.\n- **Secure Communication**: Utilize HTTPS for all API calls to ensure encrypted communication and protect sensitive information during transmission.\n- **Monitoring and Anomaly Detection**: Implement monitoring to detect any anomalous activity related to your API key or endpoints, notifying you of potentially unauthorized access. [You can monitor your use pattern here](/settings/api-keys).\n- **Revocation and Rotation**: Know the procedures for revoking and rotating API keys if there is suspicion of compromised security, ensuring continuity and integrity of service. [You have full controls to remove or add a new API keys in the api-keys user section](/settings/api-keys).\n\n## Always Available Support\n\nWhether you have queries, face challenges, or seek deeper insights, our [dedicated support team is just a click away](https://support.ccdata.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new), eager to assist and guide. \n\nOur **Enterprise plans** provide **24-hour email and Slack support** access, with direct communication links to our developers and product owners, reflecting our core belief that **'We all succeed together'**. This mantra drives every endeavor, emphasizing collective growth and collaboration as the keystones to true success in the digital asset industry—a global industry where **markets never sleep**. Even though we're based in the UK, we recognize that your journey through this ever-evolving space should not be hindered by your timezone or location. Thus, our support infrastructure at CoinDesk is as widespread as the industry we serve, offering **24-hour support** and **on-call engineers during office hours**, with best efforts out of hours in situations of extreme urgency.\n\nWith our always-available support, we guarantee a seamless experience, reflecting the global and timeless nature of the industry we serve. **Trust us to be your steadfast companion, around the clock, around the globe**.\n\n## A Transparent Approach to Rate Limiting:\n\nIn the ever-evolving realm of digital assets, we understand the **importance of simplicity and clarity**. At CoinDesk, we've adopted an **intuitive approach to rate limiting**, focusing on individual API calls rather than the often perplexing credit system. This ensures a straightforward experience for our users, devoid of any ambiguities.\n\n**Each API call you make, irrespective of its complexity or the data it retrieves, is counted uniformly**. This approach ensures not only ease of understanding but also greater transparency in monitoring your usage. With CoinDesk, you're always aware of your consumption, **empowering you to make informed decisions without getting entangled in the intricacies of credit calculations**. Our commitment remains unwavering: **to deliver an experience that's as seamless as it is transparent**.\n\n**We enforce rate limits at the account level rather than per API key**. This means that all API keys associated with your account share the same rate limit quotas. You can generate multiple API keys to manage and monitor different applications, services, or teams, providing flexibility in how you organize your access.\n\nWhile you can **obtain usage statistics and monitor activity per API key, the overall rate limits apply collectively to your entire account**. This approach ensures that your total API usage remains within your subscription's allocated limits, regardless of how many API keys you have or how they are used.\n\n**Benefits of Account-Level Rate Limiting:**\n- **Flexibility**: Manage multiple projects or teams by using separate API keys under the same account without worrying about individual rate limits. However, if you prefer to isolate usage (dev, staging, production) or have separate rate limits, we recommend using multiple accounts. Even a free API key might suffice (for dev and staging) since most endpoints are available on the free tier. If you require higher limits for these additional accounts, we can easily provide you with separate accounts that have their own rate limits, distinct from your main account. Please **mention your requirements to our sales or support team**, and we'll be **happy to assist you in setting up the appropriate accounts to meet your needs**.\n- **Monitoring**: Track usage and performance metrics for each API key to identify usage patterns or potential issues in specific applications.\n- **Control**: Easily revoke or regenerate API keys if necessary without affecting your overall rate limit.\n- **Important Note**: Be mindful that heavy usage from one API key can impact the available rate limit for other keys under the same account. It's essential to coordinate usage across your applications to avoid unintentionally exceeding your account's rate limits.\n\nYou can readily verify your rate limit by visiting our [Rate Limit Verification Endpoint](/documentation/data-api/admin_v2_rate_limit). While this action consumes one of your rate limit calls, there's no cause for concern. All our API responses are equipped with a range of headers that offer detailed insights into your rate limiting status:\n- **X-Ratelimit-Limit**: Indicates the maximum number of requests you can make within specific time frames. It sets your usage capacity limits for different windows (e.g., per second, minute, hour, day, month).\n- **X-Ratelimit-Remaining**: Shows how many requests you have left in the current rate limit window.\n- **X-Ratelimit-Remaining-All**: Provides a detailed count of remaining requests across all time windows.\n- **X-Ratelimit-Reset**: Tells you when the current rate limit window resets, in seconds.\n- **X-Ratelimit-Reset-All**:  Shows reset times for all rate limit windows.\n\nHere is an example of response headers with comments about how they work:\n```\nX-Ratelimit-Limit:\n  100000000, # First Entry (Monthly Limit): 100000000 requests per month.\n  38;window=1;burst=600;policy=\"fixed window\", # Per Second Limit: 38 requests; window=1 second; burst=600.\n  2241;window=60;burst=30000;policy=\"fixed window\", # Per Minute Limit: 2241 requests; window=60 seconds; burst=30000.\n  134409;window=3600;burst=1000000;policy=\"fixed window\", # Per Hour Limit: 134409 requests; window=3600 seconds; burst=1000000.\n  3225807;window=86400;burst=9000000;policy=\"fixed window\", # Per Day Limit: 3225807 requests; window=86400 seconds; burst=9000000.\n  100000000;window=2678400;policy=\"fixed window\" # Monthly Limit with Window: 100000000 requests; window=2678400 seconds (~31 days).\n\nX-Ratelimit-Remaining: 66676658 # You have 66,676,658 requests remaining in your monthly limit.\n\nX-Ratelimit-Remaining-All:\n  66676658, # First Entry (Monthly Remaining): 66676658 requests left this month.\n  599;window=1, # Per Second Remaining: 599 requests left in the current second.\n  29956;window=60, # Per Minute Remaining: 29956 requests left in the current minute.\n  919204;window=3600, # Per Hour Remaining: 919204 requests left in the current hour.\n  7626094;window=86400, # Per Day Remaining: 7626094 requests left in the current day.\n  66676658;window=2678400 # Monthly Remaining with Window: 66676658 requests left; window=2678400 seconds.\n\nX-Ratelimit-Reset: 1191769 # Your monthly rate limit resets in 1,191,769 seconds.\n\nX-Ratelimit-Reset-All:\n  1191769, # First Entry (Monthly Reset): Resets in 1191769 seconds.\n  1;window=1, # Per Second Reset: Resets in 1 second.\n  17;window=60, # Per Minute Reset: Resets in 17 seconds.\n  17;window=3600, # Per Hour Reset: Resets in 17 seconds.\n  25217;window=86400, # Per Day Reset: Resets in 25,217 seconds.\n  1191769;window=2678400 # Monthly Reset with Window: Resets in 1191769 seconds; window=2678400 seconds.\n```\nNote: The first entry in each header always refers to the monthly limit.\n\n**How to Utilize Rate Limit Headers Effectively**\n- **Monitor Your Usage**: Regularly check the X-Ratelimit-Remaining and X-Ratelimit-Remaining-All headers to avoid exceeding your limits.\n- **Optimize Request Timing**: Use the X-Ratelimit-Reset and X-Ratelimit-Reset-All headers to plan your requests around reset times, ensuring efficient use of your rate limits.\n- **Implement Back-off Strategies**: If you're approaching your rate limit, consider slowing down your request rate or temporarily pausing requests until the limit resets.\n- **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors gracefully by implementing retry logic based on the reset timers provided.\n\n## CCSEQ for Unmatched Reliability\n\nOur **CCSEQ (CoinDesk Sequence)** sets a new standard in the field of digital asset data provision, sharply distinguishing us from other data providers. Here's an insight into how CCSEQ functions and why it's integral to our and your operations:\n\n- **Sequential Design**: CCSEQ's **gapless**, **always-increasing numerical value**, in a **sequential order**, ensures continuity across transactions, independent of the original generation time of trades or messages.\n- **Efficient Non-Chronological Handling**: CCSEQ's non-chronological methodology circumvents constant reordering, overcoming network delays and timestamp discrepancies, maintaining efficiency and consistency without time-of-occurrence limitations.\n- **Accuracy and Integrity**: The validation process for each CCSEQ incrementation is rigorous. Even in exceptional cases where a message is processed and found INVALID — a detection made by our research and data analysts — the CCSEQ stays unchanged, protecting the sequence's integrity.\n- **Reliable Integration and Processing**: The CCSEQ architecture's flexibility facilitates the integration of missed or out-of-sequence messages, ensuring accuracy and reliability, and satisfying intricate data processing demands without sacrificing integrity.\n- **Enhanced User Experience**: Within the CCSEQ system, specific endpoints divide valid messages into the Data response array and invalid ones into the Invalid array. This design assures a smooth experience for users, devoid of any CCSEQ sequence gaps.\n\nBy employing the innovative CCSEQ system, we uphold stringent precision and robustness in our data management, boosting the dependability of digital asset data streams. The application of CCSEQ emphasizes our devotion to supplying uninterrupted and error-tolerant service, confirming that every processed piece of data adds to a consistent and exhaustive technical insight into the digital asset market.\n\n## Versioning and Deprecation Policy\n\nDocumentation is available for both the CryptoComapre 'Min API' and CoinDesk 'Data API'. You can toggle between the documentation for each of these with the drop down in the top left of the page. The Data API is CoinDesk's currently supported API platform - all endpoints have the base url [https://data-api.coindesk.com](https://data-api.coindesk.com/). \n\nThe **Data API** will **provide access** to all of the **newest products and data types**, and we **recommend** its use to all new API users. While some of the endpoints might be available without an API_KEY (for ease of access by decentralized apps) we recommend always registering an account and passing an api key to any endpoint you use.\n\nThe **Min API** gives options for both a REST and Websocket connection but is considered deprecated and, as of  November 2023, it will not be receiving any new updates.\n\nPeriodically, we will make changes and updates to the functionality of certain endpoints, which could result in a new version of the endpoint becoming available for use. In these cases, the old version will become deprecated and replaced in the documentation by the new version. Any deprecated endpoints will continue to function as they initially did with no changes. Documentation on functionality for these deprecated endpoints will all still be available, but will be moved to the [Deprecated Section](/documentation/data-api/deprecated) of the product list.\n\n**Deprecation Header Notification**: To assist developers in identifying deprecated endpoints programmatically, we include a Deprecation HTTP response header in the responses from deprecated endpoints. This header will have a value of true, indicating that the endpoint is deprecated. We may also include a date parameter specifying the deprecation date. Clients are encouraged to check for this header and plan their migrations accordingly.\n\n**Important Advisory on Deprecated Endpoints**: While we are dedicated to promoting a decentralized ecosystem and enhancing user accessibility (by ocasionally allowing IP Rate limits on some endpoints), it's crucial to note that endpoints will switch to **api_key**-only access six months after their deprecation date. For those already utilizing an **api_key**, this change will have no impact and they should focus on migrating to the new endpoints. This shift is designed to uphold the integrity and reliability of our service offerings. If you are currently relying on deprecated endpoints, we strongly recommend either integrating an api_key within this six-month timeframe or migrating to the new version to ensure continuous, uninterrupted access to the data you require.\n\n## Your Reliable Partner in Digital Assets: CoinDesk\n\nNavigate the complexities of the financial world with the CoinDesk Digital Asset REST API.

They encompass a unique blend of innovation and detailed scrutiny, offering an array of methodologies to meet diverse demands. Leveraging our numerous data integrations, our indices offer both cutting-edge insights and a comprehensive view into historical trends. Esteemed names from the index industry, who are our valued clients, bear testimony to our excellence in this domain. Further amplifying our portfolio are over **200 bespoke indices**, each masterfully curated, maintained, and periodically rebalanced to mirror specific market sentiments. To further enhance reliability, each index update is tagged with our proprietary CCSEQ (CoinDesk Sequence). This allows users to consistently and reliably track every index update.\n\n**Four prime exemplars of our indices are**:\n\n- **CCIX (CoinDesk Aggregated Index - Formerly CCCAGG)**: Regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and EU BMR Compliant, CCIX provides an accurate and reliable real-time reference price benchmark for cryptocurrency traders and investors to value their portfolios at any time. CoinDesk proprietary CCIX methodology is calculated as a 24-hour volume-weighted average price, ensuring the benchmark is market-representative and replicable. Through the implementation of a meticulous exchange selection methodology, CoinDesk secures that only the most reliable and trustworthy exchanges are included in the calculation. Thus, CCIX not only represents a fair cryptoasset price but also provides a reliable measure of direct 'Top-tier' volumes. CCIX is calculated for each cryptocurrency in every market where it is traded (example: CCIX BTC-USD, CCIX BTC-EUR). You can read the full product description for CCIX (formerly CCCAGG) on our [CCIX reference rate product and methodology page](https://ccdata.io/indices/ccix).\n- **CADLI (CoinDesk Adaptive Diversified Liquidity Index)**: CADLI provides an accurate and reliable real-time average market price, which can be used for price discovery, especially in illiquid markets. CoinDesk proprietary methodology for CADLI blends all available markets for a given cryptocurrency and returns a consolidated 24-hour volume-weighted average USD price, offering a simple and easy-to-understand cryptoasset reference. CADLI conversions are also available through CoinDesk API, allowing the user to specify any quote currency. For example, the user can request BTC-ETH, and the endpoint will return the CADLI BTC-USD price converted into ETH. Moreover, as CADLI blends all available markets, users can see the complete market liquidity/volume for an asset and gain a comprehensive overview of trading activity. Additionally, users can decide which particular markets are more pertinent to their analysis, such as only 'top-tier' exchanges. You can read the full product description for CADLI (the CoinDesk Adaptive Diversified Liquidity Index) on our [CADLI reference rate product and methodology page](https://ccdata.io/indices/cadli).\n- **CoinDesk Blended Prices**: Regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and EU BMR Compliant, CoinDesk Blended Prices provide an alternative to investors seeking a benchmark that combines stablecoins and fiat currencies into a consolidated USD reference price. The proprietary methodology for CoinDesk Blended Prices is calculated as a 24-hour volume-weighted average price using a customised selection of exchanges and an outlier detection methodology, converting the final prices into USD.\n- **DA Fixings (CoinDesk Digital Asset Fixings)**: CoinDesk Digital Asset Fixings Index (DA Fixings) offers a settlement index for each currency pair, providing traders and investors with the most reliable, market-representative price for portfolio valuation. This proprietary methodology involves a 10-minute time-weighted average based on the company’s FCA-regulated CCIX benchmark family. The standard DA Fixings follow a 4:00 pm London time standard, however, the user can specify any time and specific timezone on CoinDesk API.

These endpoints grant direct access to **Automated Market Makers (AMMs) swaps** and **liquidity metrics** on multiple exchanges from multiple blockchains.\n\n**Automated Market Makers (AMMs)** are decentralized protocols that **allow digital assets to be traded in a permissionless and automatic way**. Instead of relying on traditional order books to match buyers and sellers, AMMs use algorithms and liquidity pools to facilitate trades, making them a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nOur On-Chain DEX interface assures uniformity, allowing users to seamlessly access data from different decentralized platforms without grappling with varied formats. A unique feature that sets us apart is the standardized AMM Mapping—ensuring that fetched data aligns perfectly with the user-specified liquidity pair or trading protocol, thereby eliminating discrepancies across platforms.\n\nThe **On-Chain DEX integrations** perform detailed parsing, validation, and analysis of every transaction to produce an exceptionally rich dataset. Our granular approach ensures a quality of data that can't be achieved when pulling directly from a blockchain explorer. We utilize **real-time blockchain nodes** and **third-party backup blockchain data providers** and we acquire data both from the mempool and confirmed blocks, guaranteeing timely and exhaustive data collection. To fortify reliability, each transaction is tagged with a proprietary CCSEQ, letting users keep track of every transaction without omissions or overlaps.\n\n**Blockchain reorganizations** are inherently disruptive but are **a reality in decentralized networks**. Our system is designed to handle them seamlessly. Each swap and liquidity event is initially tagged with a 'PENDING' status until a sufficient number of confirmations (blocks) have passed. Should a reorg occur, we update the status of the affected swaps and liquidity events to 'INVALID'. We then process the reorged block, issue new unique On-chain Sequence IDs (CCSEQ) for the new messages, and update the derived data sets. On the **Ethereum network**, our system accommodates a **reorg size of up to 100 blocks** to ensure the highest level of data accuracy and reliability.\n\nWe leverage our own [asset endpoints](/documentation/data-api/onchain_v2_summary_by_chain) for the discovery of new assets and employ our dedicated [on-chain full block endpoints](/documentation/data-api/onchain_v1_block_2) and streaming integrations for real-time block processing. All data is stored unmapped, identified by a unique combination dex name, base asset address, quote asset address and chain asset ID. On the API endpoints, we map these raw values and apply the appropriate decimal point conversions to deliver end values that are both accurate and user-friendly.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Real-Time Transaction Capture**: With real-time blockchain intregrations, we ensure the immediate and comprehensive acquisition of on-chain data.\n- **AMM-Specific Metrics**: Detailed metrics are derived from AMM transactions, revealing depth, volume, and liquidity conditions.\n- **Standardized AMM Mapping**: Our rigorous standardization process assures that users obtain the exact data they request across multiple decentralized platforms.\n- **Enhanced Historical Data Access**: Leverage our expansive historical data, which includes metrics such as swaps, liquidity changes, and transaction fees.\n- **CCSEQ for Consistent Tracking**: Every on-chain swap and liquidity update is tagged with a unique CCSEQ, ensuring seamless and gapless monitoring.\n- **Comprehensive Liquidity Metrics**: Our endpoints provide vital information on liquidity pools, available liquidity, and slippage risks.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- **Defi Analytics Platforms**: Utilize our On-Chain DEX endpoints to create robust analytics platforms capable of interpreting decentralized market activities.\n- **Asset Management**: Real-time and historical metrics can inform liquidity provisioning strategies for decentralized portfolio managers.\n- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Evaluate AMM swap effectiveness and smart contract interactions for auditing purposes.\n- **Risk Management**: Keep an eye on liquidity conditions to make informed decisions on risk mitigation in decentralized environments.\n- **Market Research**: Researchers can dive into our in-depth dataset for market reports, liquidity analysis, and trend forecasting.\n- **Regulatory and Compliance**: Use the CCSEQ to monitor and audit transactions across decentralized protocols, ensuring transparency.\n- **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Identify opportunities for decentralized arbitrage by analyzing liquidity and volume metrics.\n- **Financial Systems Integration**: Integrate our On-Chain DEX data into existing fintech platforms to expand their reach into decentralized markets.\n\nOur On-Chain DEX endpoints are meticulously designed to be the best resource for **real-time and historical data from decentralized asset markets**.

This means:\n\n- They are **no longer recommended** for use and may not be supported in future versions of our API.\n- Existing implementations that use these may continue to work, but we **cannot guarantee their long-term reliability**.\n- We **strongly recommend migrating** to the suggested alternatives as soon as possible to ensure compatibility and access to new features.\n\nAs our API evolves, we aim to provide more robust, efficient, and useful features. This sometimes requires retiring older functionalities to make room for better approaches. Deprecation decisions are based on:\n\n- **Performance Enhancements**: Newer alternatives might be faster or more resource-efficient.\n- **Feature Improvements**: Deprecated features may lack newer capabilities.\n- **Consistency and Standards**: Aligning with modern practices or industry standards.\n- **Simplified Maintenance**: Reducing complexities that arise from supporting outdated functionalities.\n\n## Deprecation and Removal Process\n\nOur commitment to innovation means we sometimes need to retire old functionalities. Here's how we ensure a smooth transition:\n\n- **Announcement**: When an endpoint, parameter, or functionality is identified for deprecation, we'll mark it as such in our documentation and notify users through email and other communication channels.\n- **Support Period**: Deprecated features will continue to be supported for a period to allow users ample time for migration. This period will be specified, but expect at least several months to a few years.\n- **Deprecation Header Notification**: To assist developers in identifying deprecated endpoints programmatically, we include a Deprecation HTTP response header in the responses from deprecated endpoints. This header will have a value of true, indicating that the endpoint is deprecated. If a new version of the endpoint is available, we will also include a Link header pointing to the new version. Developers are encouraged to check for these headers and plan their migrations accordingly.\nWhen deprecating /admin/v1/rate/limit in favor of /admin/v2/rate/limit, where we've changed the response format and added types to each object for improved clarity and functionality, the headers in the response would look like:\n```\nDeprecation: true\nLink: </admin/v2/rate/limit>; rel=\"successor-version\"\n```\n- **Removal Checks**: After the support period, we'll monitor the use of these deprecated features. As long as they are still actively used, they won't be removed.\n- **Final Notification**: If, after several checks, we find that usage has dwindled or become minimal, we'll send a final removal notification. Users will receive another grace period, potentially up to multiple years, before the feature is fully removed.\n- **Deletion**: After the final grace period, and if no significant usage is detected, the deprecated functionality will be permanently removed from our API.\n\n**Important Advisory on Deprecated Endpoints**: While we are dedicated to promoting a decentralized ecosystem and enhancing user accessibility (occasionally allowing IP rate limits on some endpoints), it's crucial to note that endpoints will switch to api_key-only access six months after their deprecation date. For those already utilizing an api_key, this change will have no impact, and they should focus on migrating to the new endpoints. This shift is designed to uphold the integrity and reliability of our service offerings. If you are currently relying on deprecated endpoints, we strongly recommend either integrating an api_key within this six-month timeframe or migrating to the new version to ensure continuous, uninterrupted access to the data you require.\n\n## Migration Tips\n\n- **Monitor Deprecated Features**: Regularly check this section during API updates to ensure you're not relying on deprecated features.\n- **Plan Early**: Begin your migration as soon as possible. Even though deprecated features remain functional for a time, they may be removed in the future. We assure you that we won't remove endpoints as long as they are still being used. We'll reach out via email and other means to existing customers using deprecated endpoints and provide plenty of time (multiple years) for them to switch to the new endpoints.\n- **Utilize the Deprecation Header**: Make sure your applications check for the Deprecation HTTP response header to programmatically identify deprecated endpoints and receive deprecation dates and alternative endpoints via the Link header.\n- **Seek Support**: If you face any issues during migration, please reach out to our support team. We're here to help.\n\nNavigating the ever-evolving landscape of technology can be challenging, but it's an integral part of continuous improvement and innovation. Deprecating certain functionalities in our API is a testament to our commitment to offering only the best, most efficient, and reliable tools for our users. We understand the potential inconveniences this might cause, and we deeply appreciate your adaptability during these changes.
